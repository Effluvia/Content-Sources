This is a small LAN map I made in the spring of 2004, just intended for a bit of fun. It's not to be taken too seriously.

The principle behind it was to create something that was open and dark to the extent that it really can be played in a number of ways. Personally, I liked to try to sneak to the other side of the river,  whilst others would man the sniper towers and start wars between the two sides. It's designed to be very open, whilst densely populated with bits to hide in. Most of all, it's designed to be fun, specifically when you know who you're playing with. Nothing beats sneaking round, headshotting an enemy, then hearing the cry/shout/scream of a housemate down the corridor.

The bomb site and the hostages are really just there for fun - most of the time, rounds end through pure slaughter. Although sometimes we have seen rounds end 30 seconds after they started because someone rushed and completed the objective, which are usually really hectic rounds...

Also note the spectacular lightning bug. Occasionally, it won't stop. The place becomes very very bright.

(Note: Whilst the RMF and WAD file are included, I no longer have the lights.rad file, so the map may not compile properly. Although I can't remember if it needs lights.rad anyway... if it does, it's pretty easy to add the appropriate values. Just tinker a bit to make sure both sides get equal amounts of illumination.)


I grant everyone and anyone (except Fabian Trevelyan) permission to edit, change, port and re-release this map, provided this file stays intact with it, or a link is provided to my website in an accompanying text file (this is so others can see where the map came from and can have a look themselves).
