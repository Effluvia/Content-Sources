The combintaion is 9341.

To change the first digit you need to edit the keypad so that your first digit points to
CombiLevel2 and all others point to CombiReset (remember case sensetive)

The first row of point entities in front of the lock are the reset - each button pressed in
your combination need to be reset by one of these.

The other digits need to be set in the other rows.

Note that your first digit (9 in this example) cannot appear anywhere else in the
combination.

give appropriate credits in the readme.
