Maybe some other stuff that I've forgotten.


You are free to use this map on your server.

If you use v1 which was originally made for The Ice Cave then please don't change any of its textures or make them unreadable by placing something over with it with a plugin.
If you work on making your own version of Frozen Valley with the released source then by all means give credits where credits are due.

V2 was never finished due to The Ice Cave rp dying out on TSRP and once we made our last comeback there were plans for working on v2, but sadly hammer doesn't seem to work properly on Vista.

I would like to thank everybody for their support with this map and there help while making it.

Furthermore enjoy the map and keep in mind that this basically was my first proper map where I learned how to use hammer. Due to this some some fps drops may happen on 
weaker computers, feel free to optimize  :P

Source release.
____________________________________

Cause I'm not going to work on Frozen Valley any more nor plan or able to do so. I've decided to publicly release it to the public.
You are allowed to edit the map in any way just give proper credits where they are due and respect the author, me.
I mainly release this map for others to learn from and work on improving Frozen Valley to its full potential.

Keep in mind as stated above this was one of my first maps where I rly learned how to make maps properly with hammer thus making not everything as optimized as it can be.
The main concern is the draw distance from one side to the other side of the map, with ts3 released it should be possible to make the view distance considerable shorter and add snow/fog to cover up the distance you can see. This is for future mappers to do :)
If you decide on working on Frozen valley, I wish you good luck and let me know how it turns out.

Furthermore I would like to point out that The Ice Cave TSRP will never come back again.
I've recently have gotten several requests to restart The Ice Cave TSRP so consider this my final answer. The Ice Cave TSRP was great while it lasted and I enjoyed it a lot, although its a lot of work I wish to thank all the rpers I've played with and thank the loyal The Ice Cave players.

I salute you with cake !
