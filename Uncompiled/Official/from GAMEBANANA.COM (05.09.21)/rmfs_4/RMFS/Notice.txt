After our meeting with Valve a few weeks ago and subsequent discussions amongst the mod team we have decided to make substantial changes to our current porting rules concerning the use of Valve's intellectual property (IP) and assets. As of today users will be able to upload files that uses Valve content in non-valve titles (for example: a mod that allows you to play as Gordon Freeman in GTA:V), provided it meets the following criteria:

    Non-Profit - Users may not sell, monetise, or otherwise profit from the use of Valve's assets or any submission containing derivatives of Valve IP.
    Credits - it is important to respect copyright, when using Valve's assets in your submissions you must clearly state so and give Valve appropriate credit for any items used.
    Non-defamatory - Valve works hard to maintain its reputation amongst gamers, you are not allowed to use Valve assets in anything that may damage their brand, or negatively affect their company.
    Discretion & Ownership - Valve owns all rights to their content and content produced on their engines. They may, at their discretion request any item to be removed, at any time, with or without reason. GameBanana and it's network sites must respond to their requests promptly and take reasonable steps to pro-actively remove any content that does not conform to the terms above.

Please note - This is an informal agreement between GameBanana and Valve employee's, it does not offer any form of legal protection, or allow you to use Valve assets on other websites or services. This agreement may be subject to change at any point.
