Motivation

As I was asked so often and helped many mappers
I finally decided to release the .rmf file of jb_snow.
I hope the entity constructions help you to build own
new minigames, you can also create a remake of
the map under the following conditions.

Terms of Use

You may both edit the map and extract parts out of it
but make sure to mention me (=tObI=) in the credits
and do not present it as your own work.
If you build a remake of jb_snow you may add your
name to the credits but do not remove any names.

Compile settings

CSG:	-noinfo -nowadtextures
BSP:	-noinfo
