A1a4:

- Script at end of c1a4 to make the player fly when hitting the brakes

- Monsters and AI Nodes, make barney & construction prisoners so they don't get killed

- Toss some goodies at the end of the branch

a1a4a

- Make a1a4a more interesting (pipes, enemies, idk)
	Toss a room on the middle of the curve
	Add ladder/staircase if the player falls to the radiation pool

- Lighting on transition part from a1a4a to a1a4b

- Faulty brushwork on chamber from-and-to generator silo

- Brushwork/Texture work on hall out of/to generator (a1a4d)
	- Enemies
	- Env_sounds
	- Nodes
	- Better visual cues when generators are zapping the water pools
	- Same with tension meters at the start of the map

- Brushwork/Texture work on OXY/FUEL part
	- Implement new pipe textures by dead
		- Done, but there's a color difference I didn't see on the PSDs (maybe from indexing?) and the pipes need their UVs perfected.
	- Tweak texlights on transition chambers so they are consistent on both ends
	- Door scripting in actual oxy fuel room
		- Clip the valves around so they don't hurt the player when rotating
	- Sewer part needs to be work on, I have no ideas, but i want to keep the branch as an optional area with goodies n shit
	- Make main first hall better, toss enemies n shit

- A1A4C
	- Better proper lighting in halls,
	- Dimmer/Darker lighting in tentacle pit
	- Lighting in security hatch
	
- A1A4F
	- Change first room's purpose
	- Get rid of barney with 357
	- Get rid of room with 2 shutters, replace with 1 big shutter that leads to the screenshot we got from the archive
	- Get rid of the small pipe, replace it with a big pipe which is a branch from the main one
	- Proper lighting in the den area
	- Fix Zed's grate script (doesn't work) make it a normal func_door tied to a func_rot_button
	- Fix Zed's trigger_pushes they are too strong and softlocks the player if they didn't open the door first

theuaredead additions:
split A1A4F into A1A4F and A1A4G, G is supposed to be the later half and F is the part after going through the pipe in the silo
Image in Ultimate PC (high-res found in Barnz archive) is likely apart of A1A4G, as a part of the connection to A2A1.
imo I don't like how A1A4 connects to A2A1, feels cheap, forced, and crude.

A1A4E -
Vent connection on the top of the fan room needs re-done, Valve's geometry is lazy and bad
