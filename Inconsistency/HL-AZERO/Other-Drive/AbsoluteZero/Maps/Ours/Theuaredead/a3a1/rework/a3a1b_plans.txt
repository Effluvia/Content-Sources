- Opening doesn't directly tie into the old alpha room (dance_troupe.jpg)
	- Likely had the dome room from the alpha. The room that the photographed room led into. Somewhere inbetween there's a changelevel and perhaps the elevator back to a3a1.
- Maintence Room is something ripped out of retail Datacore, unsure if it was in the map originally, but I'd assume this was the area that had the shit to shut off the power.
	- Stairs need the newer detail that the rest of the stairs have.
- The Observation Area needs to be reattached still.
	- Based upon the one seen in OaR, but retain the two door ways.
- The two doors attached to the main room, and the one door on the upper side of the Computer Room should be powered up, like they are currently on HLAZ
	- The upper computer room door needs to be updated to match the main room doors.
	- Unless this isn't that good of an idea, I mean, you are able to break the glass and get in.
- What purpose will the computer room (Data Control Operations) have?
	- Did it have a purpose in the alpha?
	- Back computers are not how they were in the beta screenshot we have. Compare the photo with the alpha and see if the brushwork is the same.
- Rad Coorridor needs to be cleaned up
	- Clean up everything, and if push comes to shove, start transplanting current HLAZ stuff in.
	- The elevator there leads to the Sat Dish
- Lights are inconsistent throughout the map
	- Make sure there's even light placement and there's no area that clearly is designed to have a light that doesn't have a light.
	- Check in with both the alpha and retail map.
- Copy over the nodes from retail and start building from there.
	- To note, the map is now aligned with the alpha map, I aligned it with the front brush of the desk in the main room.
- Our Lab1_Map1 needs to be split in half, this is why retail's version is here
	- Yell at me to do this.
- Transplant logical weapon and item placement from Datacore (MP version)
	- no idea how much is logical, and some of it is already in the map to begin with.
- Railing needs to be updated with proper brush based ones instead of the transparent ones.
- Grunts will still return to ambush you upon returning from the Sat Dish.
- DO NOT OVERWRITE ANY VERSION OF THE MAP
	- Do not overwrite my Rework one
	- Do not overwrite the modifed rework one that you started back in January
	- Do not overwrite the old version.
