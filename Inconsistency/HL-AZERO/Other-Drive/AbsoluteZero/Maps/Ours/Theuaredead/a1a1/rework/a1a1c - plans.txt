- This is Box Puzzle and Generator.
- First you complete the box puzzle, make it different from how we have it in HLAZ.
	- We know that there were Scientists in this map and you would be able to crush them with the boxes.
	- so, it's safe to assume all boxes could go all the way to the ground, or at least close to it.
- I only moved down the floor from the hallway and not the ceiling.
	- So that will need to be moved down like it is in retail.
- You obviously got from this room into the Generator section somehow.
	- I presume the door in retail was still there, likely being a door that took you to the generator.
	- Perhaps reuse one of the alpha staircases.
	- Also, possibly reuse the generator room from the alpha instead of pulling a lever.
		- If you do reuse this room, make sure it one of the switches you pull, maybe even have the lights turn on in certain sections, like the sections where the boxes go.
	- How you got ontop of the box, I don't know.
