- Add back in scripting from retail and HLAZ maps.
	- If there's anything strange that you're not sure existed originally, just ask.
- Make sure everything is on grid.
- Make sure textures are consistent.
	- Hold down alt and press right click while you apply textures to other brushes, it will apply accurate textures to the brush next to it, very useful.
- Make sure everything is visgrouped correctly.
- Make sure every map connects into each other.
- Most doors' windows got replaced with this metal grate texture.
	- These need replaced with their glass texture, there's some lone door in the retail maps that still uses the old glass texture windows.
	- The glass is also above the double doors.
- No, that vending machine from the Dank and Scud comic was not there originally.
	- Do not add it back in, I don't want another months worth of arguements and fights over its existance again.
