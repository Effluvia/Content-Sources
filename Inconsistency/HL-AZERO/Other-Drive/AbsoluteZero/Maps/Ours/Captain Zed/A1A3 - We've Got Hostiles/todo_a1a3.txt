To-do for demo:


Add ending with post mortem as soon as you press the silo door button (use uplink's message & fadeout as reference)

Make it so the fire doors close behind the player (place trigger in a distance so the player can't rush it and get stuck) with lights and beeping sound.

Make the osprey not flip (maybe we should recreate the path_corner).
