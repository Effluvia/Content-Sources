merge the generator room with canaproto1 (warehouse is a separated map)

make it so the zombie room fits and connects to the generator room (a one-way door at the end of the hallway would do the trick)

(notice how there is a curve at the end of the crate tunnels on the pictures we have, use it on your advantage)

the lever should move the box (so a player that got into the room via the warehouse haves a way out) and open the elevator doors, letting the player getting into it and go to a1a2

we should add some signs (maybe make the VOX to said something) so a casual player knows what to do, or at least search around the map.

Ideas for sign - lab1_acs1/2 for elevator
		 MANOVER for lever
		 SIGN40 for zombie room door leading to generator
		 SIGN84 for tunnel from warehouse to generator
