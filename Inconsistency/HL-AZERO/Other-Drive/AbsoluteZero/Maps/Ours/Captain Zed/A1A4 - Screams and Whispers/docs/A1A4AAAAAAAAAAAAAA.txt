A1A4 - Blast Pit

Start: It's alright so far, we have to get rid of the old intro on a1a4 (lift shaft), maybe add a door at the side of it, idk, just put a reason for that end of the rail to exist.

Tentacle silo: we have to improve our way to access the tentacle's pit, the retail tunnel is alright but it used to work fine on retail because the bit itself was flooded and water gets rid of the falling damage.

Tentacle Pit: Was thinking the whole path to a2a1 should be longer this is my plan so far:
		*First we get to the bottom, that area with the shutters, that should be fine as we have it, 
		*Once we get to the middle of that area with the bullsquid, we should encounter that big room from retail that haves base.mdl on it, but flipped upside down so it looks like some venting atrium or anything like that, surrounded with radiation
		*Inside of it we will find a lots of horizontal pipes, one of them with an opening
		*once we get into it, it will takes us to that map we referenced from the worldcraft screenshot, just keep it like we did.
		*We hop into the pipe, and while the water pushes us to a2a1, we should get stopped by a grate, where we can see a ladder on top of the pipe that leads us to that storage room on a2a1
