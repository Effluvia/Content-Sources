- Make all Medkit stations like the non-openable ones (they're too gimicky and dont even work sometimes)
- Replace all ladders and railings (and any other cut down brush) to actual mapped out ones, instead of one with transparency.
- Be sure the A1A0 and A1A1 geometry are matching and are not conflicting each other
- Be sure various prefabs and brushes that are constantly used are matching each other instead of having various shapes and sizes (maybe make a prefab folder?)
- Fix broken/missing geometry in various maps (get new geometry from Slart Tart converts)  DONE
- Fix textures
- Tweak maps so they use all the new features (canisters, airtanks, longjump charges)
- Tweak/trim/optimize maps so the new sparks aren't to spammy (one good example is a1a1's control room) and also they don't get stuck on brushes (another example is a1a1b's hev barney pc)
- Fewer hallways! I'm looking at you Office Complex
- AUTOSAVES

- Reconvert all retail maps, since my converts weren't clean at all.
