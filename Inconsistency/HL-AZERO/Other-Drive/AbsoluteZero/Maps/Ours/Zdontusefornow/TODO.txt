General:
	- Be sure various Prefabs are consistant.
	- Be sure textures are aligned.
	- Be sure everything is structured correctly.
	- Be sure all Scientists in the Post-Diaster maps have the Post-Diaster skins

A1A0:
	- Merge Pre and Post Disaster Maps into One Chapter (pre: a1a0, a1a0a post: a1a0b, a1a0c)
	- Test Chamber should be a Portal Device
		- First Portal opened by Scientists, Gordon walks and back out
			- You will see the Scientist on a computer opening the Portal to return you.
		- Second Portal should be opened by Xen, Gordon walks in and back out (make an easter egg so if Gordon stays too long the portal closes and you get a game over)
			- Portal shouldn't open instantly, it should take awhile, and the Scientists should speak to you through the Portal (like in Xen in the final game)
		- There's no 3rd Portal, events of current Chamber should happen.
	- Sector B's door shouldn't be broken, you open it using the control pad in the room (There was a button maps out on it, and Barney is reaching for it in the Post, only makes sense)
A1A1:
	- First Map should be Sector B
	- Maps
		- A1A1: Unknown
		- A1A1a: Sector B's current map?
		- A1A1b: Akira Elevator
		- A1A1c: Generator
		- A1A1d: Box Puzzle?
A1A2:
	- Fine as-is?
A1A3:
	- HAssault in First Room
	- Add Turrets to C1A3
	- Maps
		- A1A3: First Map
		- A1A3a: Vents?
		- A1A3b: Something is Sneezing at you? Also Headcrabs
		- A1A3c: I'm assuming Surface.
	- HL Reboot's description of C1A3:
		The Security Complex - The Security Complex is where you’ll find the door to the Silo - you can’t get in just yet, but remember where it is. You’re going to battle through tons of shock troops en route to an airlock just the other side of them. This is a level of catwalks - climb up to them any old way you figure out (two words for you: air and duct). And don’t forget to do something about those big, ugly fans that will make mincemeat of you in mere instants.
A1A4:
	- Silo is A1A4b
