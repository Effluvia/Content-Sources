C2A2 - Didn't exist. Was originally the last map of C2A2
- path_track = c2a1lift, c2a2lift, flood, tracks, z3track

C2A2A - Altered
- Possibly were once C2A2B and C2A2F, but was forced together for retail purposes.
- Current form links into C2A2A (beta), C2A2G (beta), and C2A2H (Beta)
- Parts of the map could of been from before A2A2G or from A2A2J (judging by the old_train naming)
- path_track = z2track, z3track, flood, and start
- C2A2B1 states this map was once C2A2E

C2A2B1 - Original lead into C2A2C (labeled as C2A2H, though.) Originally was C2A2G
- Originally C2A2G, lead into C2A2H
- path_track = z3track, z3trackend, train, trainlift, gruntlift

C2A2B2 - Clearly not originally C2A2B, but what it was originally is to be found out.
- Possibly the map one of the elevators from A2A2 leads to?
- This would either be A2A2A or A2A2C
- Likely to be C2A2A due to how the elevator is presented in the map

C2A2C - Area with ISlave VS Grunts and boarded up room was originally the Grunt VS Bloaters fight from C2A2E and has it lead into C2A2F (originally C2A2H)
- C2A2H original name
- Get connected back up to A2A2I
- Figure out what all wasn't there originally. 
- There's a pipe that's not in a visgroup, and a lot of the new pieces to the map weren't visgrouped. But the backwall to it was in the visgroup. Look into that.
- path_track = train, traintime, floathumanlift

C2A2D - Unknown, but likely existed
- Zone 2, Train 2
- path_track = c2a2dbottom, train, z2track

C2A2E - Unknown, old vis groups have parts of the original map, but very minimal
- There's a screenshot of the map.
- Zone 1 would of had lead into this map, and this map would of originally lead into C2A2D (instead of C2A2D leading into C2A2E)
- Zone 2's Train 2 is in the map twice, maybe this points out where the map was extended out for retail
- path_track = c2a2e, z2track, floathumanlift, train, trainlift, blocktrack, timetrain

C2A2F - Minimally changed. Originally C2A2I
- Add wooden boxes over the new boxes that are seen in retail (Done, but they need to move)
- Find out what it lead into. (Likely to be A2A2J)
- path_track = z5crateway, timetrain,  flood, c2a2clinklft

C2A2G - originally C2A2
- Merge Back into C2A2H to generate A2A2 (Done)

C2A2H - originally C2A2
- Merge Back into C2A2G to generate A2A2 (Done)
- Left elevator C2A2C to C2A2
- Right elevator C2A2 to C2A2A


Shoehorn the Alpha On a Rail map onto the layout just because?

C2A2C in the original layout is missing? May other maps are missing? As C2A2B2 could of been C2A2A originally. 
But that leave other maps missing still, such as C2A2C, C2A2D, C2A2F, and C2A2J

C2A2B and C2A2E possibly known, I don't know.

Maybe each level of the train system had a different train. Rendering each train to not be a different beta version, but just an actual different train.
