Most of this map will need to be cut or redone, but there's major stuff needed in this map, so I will still point to the latest revision of the map.
Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\LeonelC\A2A3 - Abandoned Silo\a2a3d.jmf"
Also needed for this map is Stalkyard or, as it was originally called, Warez_DM

- Zed jank!
	- Zed forced like 3-4 maps together here and splice it together with a very non-sensical original section.
	- The way it connects from a2a3c is correct, maybe minus a door.
		- But that cafeteria section to the left wasn't there originally and looks kinda bad being there.
- Beyond that hallway, it would take you into a modified version of Warez_DM.
		- We have a photograph of Singleplayer Warez_DM.

			- We're not certain this belonged to Abandoned Silo, but considering the context of how much Riller recycled HL content and the similar theme, I say its safe to put it here.
		- You would fight HGrunts and end up in an area where you would see yourself ambushed and taken.
			- Ambush section easily breaks in the map currently, needs fixed.
			- Also, the scanline effect doesn't work on Widescreen despite it working on some other camera in the mod.
