Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a1\rework\a1a1e.jmf"

- Unknown to how this map went. It is the area where the alpha c1a1 cuts out due to maps being removed.
	- We have it connected to a section we saw in a preview for an E3 build of Half-Life.
	- We're unsure if that section is even a1a1, but the only other logical place for it to be is Screams and Whispers.
		- However, we know by that point in development (and seemly always,) Screams and Whispers was never textured with TNNL based textures.
		- We know that photo is a map that was featured in the campaign of HL, but beyond that, it is a mystery.
- This lead into an office section that led into A1A2, but we don't know how that would of been designed like.
- Fun Fact!: It appears the alpha equivalent of this map and c1a2 were excluded from the alpha due to c1a2 crashing the game.
	- In the 0.61 document, it documents c1a2 as causing the game to hang.
	- It appears it had crashed the game up until E3 1998, to which they must of decided to cut this section and c1a2 as they realized the game didn't need either section.
	- Retail's c1a2 is seemly the original c1a2a for the beta, and it is the c1a2a of the alpha.
