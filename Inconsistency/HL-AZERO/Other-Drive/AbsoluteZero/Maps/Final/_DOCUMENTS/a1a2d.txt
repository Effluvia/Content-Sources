Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a2\rework\a1a2d.jmf"

- This map was in the stages before starting to be playable.
- Several doors are missing, like the one at the start and the one at the end before you get to the alpha section of the map.
- In the area where the Zombie crashes through the window, there was likely some detail up in that area.
	- The area still exists in retail in spirit, and I guess the door and vending machine were up there like they are in retail.
- The area where the Scientist bursts through the window is prompted by a Zombie bursting through a closet door.
	- The sequence panned out similarly to the one in the retail section of the map and to the sequence in retail c1a2.
	- The closet would of been connected to the fallen office.
- In the fallen office at the end there's some general issues.
	- The areas in the ceiling where the headcrabs crash through have an optimization issue.
	- Valve would of just wrapped those areas up with a black texture and wouldn't of left the whole ceiling open.
		- Same goes with the hole in the ceiling, I recall doing that right in the original version of this map before anyone touched it.
	- I think the baby photo might of been on the floor.
		- I recall there being an interview with a Valve employee describing a fallen office in Office Warens which contained a smashed desk and that baby photo on the ground.
- Vent placement on the elevator to a1a3 is incorrect, needs to match with the alpha.
