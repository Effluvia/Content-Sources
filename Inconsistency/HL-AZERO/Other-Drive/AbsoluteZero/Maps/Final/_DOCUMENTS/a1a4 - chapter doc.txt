Screams and Whispers gives me nightmares.

Not only because it's another one of those chapters where we know so much about it but so little about it. 

It is also the same chapter where 3 of us all tried to run in different directions on where to take the chapter.

As you can tell, that did not work out well for any of us and we all collided with completely different ideas.

Fun Fact!: Screams and Whispers was supposed to ship with our Day One demo, but we legit could not make something worthwhile and not a broken mess that we just didn't ship the chapter.

If things went better prior to just throwing in the towel, Screams and Whispers likely would of still be cut. If things went REALLY well then it might of had a chance, but we were slating to not ship it.

Anything past a1a4d (so, a1a4e and beyond) were maps under the silo.
