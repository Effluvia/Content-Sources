Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Captain Zed\A2A2 - On a Rail\a2a2.jmf"

- We made the connection to On a Rail take you up instead of taking you down.
	- I recall the connection in the retail On a Rail map that was once the first map still taking you down opposed to going up
		- I could be wrong, it has been a hot minute since I played that map.
	- It is also likely some of the details around that lift in retail were original to the old connection between Footfall and On a Rail.
		- Obviously, not all of it, like the ladder.
- I think the rocket isn't set up right, I know launching it broken, I think the rocket is just some brush sitting there currently.
	- Clips through the doors.
- Scientists are supposed to let you into the elevator room once you kill all of the baddies.
	- I presume one of the elevators would be accessable while the other isn't accessable.
		- The unaccessable one was likely the one you take to get back into the map once you finish the main part of On a Rail.
- Once you are able to launch the rocket, the Scientist will let you through to the button to launch it.
	- Once you launch it, you gain access to the section to take you to Abandoned Silo.
		- This is fixed now, but I want to mention it because it drove ALL of us up a fucking wall:
		- At some point we were unable to get that lift to work. We had no idea why, we isolated it, put debuggers in the code, cut the other lift out of the map, etc
		- We thought it was impossible to have two lifts in a map.
		- Turns out, a breakable crate was too close to the lift so it just made the lift not function.
		- Fuck you crate.
