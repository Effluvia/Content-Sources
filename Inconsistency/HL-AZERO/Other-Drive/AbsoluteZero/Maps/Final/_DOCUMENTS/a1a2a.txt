Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a2\rework\zed\a1a2a.jmf"

- I've never actually tested this map out to see whatever or not Zed did the shit I told him to do.
	- It could be a completely functional map working exactly how I describe in the rework folder.
	- Or, it could be broken and behaves nothing like how I described to do!
- The section where the Scientist is in the turret room has some issues however.
	- In my original rework of the map, I added an extra detail to make the alpha door's inclusion look better
	- After starting that map, we fully learnt the door that was there in the alpha was not there in the beta at all.
	- That extra detail I added can also be seen to not exist in Dank and Scud
	- There's a ceiling lip Zed removed that exists in my rework map in "restore the ceiling lip.png"
	- You can partially make out the ceiling lip in the Dank and Scud comic.
	- I presume the strange alignment of the ceiling and wall wasn't like that originally, but got messed up when Valve cut the room.
- Changelevel to a1a2b should be in the same placement as retail
	- I don't know if Zed corrected this or not.
	- There's still a weird low detailed version of the room you go to in a1a2b instead of just a red brush.
