Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\LeonelC\A2A4 - Questionable Ethics\a2a4g.jmf"

- I like this map's concept. Despite being told it appears way too forced.
	- In the beta, you still went to the dam section of Cliff Hanger.
	- In the alpha, you went to the boot camp section of Cliff Hanger.
- However, I do think the sterilizer room you see after the AGrunt in retail should be in the map.
	- We know of this areas existence, we have a photograph of it.
	- We have animations for Barney being in this room.
	- and generally, I feel like it would flesh out the map better.
- The little side room for the Scientist is kinda jank, but the general sequence is fine.
	- I guess restoring parts of the map would allow for a better spot for you to find the Scientist.
	- Either that or one of the Scientists you escorted from the previous map will be the Scientist for this sequence.
