Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\LeonelC\A1A4 - Screams and Whispers\a1a4.jmf"

- Despite being the latest map, we actually didn't ship it with the modification!
	- The current map lacks any connection to a1a4a and it also lacks the scripted sequence to the next level.
	- Basically, it wasn't playable enough to ship in the modification.
- The scripted sequence needs readded into the map.
	- You can find the version of the map found in the build here:
	- "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a4\a1a4.jmf"
- In the version of the map we shipped, we got a lot of complaints in-regards to how lifting the barricade would start the tram after a delay.
	- We agree with that being a severe issue with the map and had actually were changing it well before the Beta Access release shipped.
	- What is supposed to happen is that you're supposed to lift the barricade and then the button by the tram will allow you to progress.
		- If the barricade is down, button won't let you progress.
- Once the scripted sequence plays, you loose control of the tram and then you crash out of it.
	- I do not know what exactly you would of lead to however.
- A thing to note:
	- We have photos of retail's c1a4k in an E3 1998 build of Half-Life. 
	- (Bullsquid_c1a4.png)
	- But, we do not know whatever or not it was apart of c1a4 originally, or was a section after you defeat the tentacles and end up under the silo.
	- Considering the organization of all of the Screams and Whispers maps got scattered in retail besides the very first one, pretty much leaves it up to guess work.
