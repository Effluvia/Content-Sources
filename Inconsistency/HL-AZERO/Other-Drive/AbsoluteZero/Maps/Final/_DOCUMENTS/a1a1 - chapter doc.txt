Unlike a1a0, a1a1 has minimal documentation. As stated in the 0.61 alpha document, Valve did not want people to talk about this chapter to avoid puzzle spoilers.

We were lucky enough that an entire section of the map, that was never covered in any other preview, was shown off in Dank and Scud. 

There might be more photos of this chapter out there, but are currently lost. 

They would of been apart of a screenshot leak of a German build of 0.61, which took unauthorized photographs of every map in the game during that build.

The full photo set is currently presumed missing, however we have various photos from said photo leak and have documentation that it would of occured sometime in May of 1998.

We, however, do not know where the leak originated from.

As for the chapter itself, it is possible that our take that retail's c1a1b was split into two is wrong. In the map list, c1a0c is not documented to exist however it is mentioned further down when they describe maps.

The document implies heavily that c1a1a was this map (or at least the later half,) which is possible that c1a0c in the document was just c1a1 and retail's c1a1b was just c1a1a. 

However we don't know that, and there's some general implication that the maps were forced together at some point due to howw the retail map is constructed.

I also provide a lot of documentation for this chapter with-in "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a1\rework"
