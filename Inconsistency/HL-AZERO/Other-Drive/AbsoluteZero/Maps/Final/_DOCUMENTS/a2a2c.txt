It's retail's c2a2e
I started this map, but I made a bunch of terrible decisions with it and forced in a ton of things that shouldn't of been there.
If you want that map, it can be found here:
"Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a2a2\a2a2c.jmf"
I strongly recommend you just use it for style and nothing else.

- Layout was different from retail, but unknown to what.
	- I don't even remember how I came up to this being a2a2c.
		- There's likely some visgroup in another map that hinted at it.
- Map did not lead into c2a2f, in fact, c2a2f wasn't even c2a2f in the beta.
	- c2a2d also likely didn't lead into this map originally.
