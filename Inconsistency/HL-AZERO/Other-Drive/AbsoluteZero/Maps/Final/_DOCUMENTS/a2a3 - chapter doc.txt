Polar-ish opposite to On a Rail, we know a decent amount about this chapter just because a lot of the blue prints were released as promotional material.

While we don't know much about this chapter beyond what we have, there's a lot of assumptions that can be made.

Looking at the maps, it is very clear this was Dave Riller's recycle chapter. The main silo bares great resemblance to the techdemo silo and somewhat the earlier alpha Screams and Whispers silo.

There's even isolated rooms in the maps completely unrelated to the chapter.

Also, this applies to basically all maps, there should be archers in the water.
