You're probably best starting from scratch on this one, Zed made this map kinda stanky.

- Instead of coming through the pipe towards the ceiling, you were supposed to go through the vat with the alien meat chunks in it.
	- Obviously, those chunks weren't there and it wasn't acid originally. Would of been a vat of water.
- It is possible that you could of fell from the hole above the vat later down the chapter.
	- Or possibly later on in the map itself.
- Rest of the map is unknown.
