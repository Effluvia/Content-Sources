Opposed to using "We've Got Hostiles," we decided to use Security Complex.

Why?

Well, we have much more info on Security Complex (likely because we legit just have the chapter.)

As far as we can tell, beta "We've Got Hostiles" was just retail with a different coat of paint and a little more condensed down. 

It is kinda lame and most people would of just thought we were slacking off and just reskinning the chapter. I recall that being the take with the demo version of the chapter and I recall people not liking the changes we did anyway.

So, two birds, one stone!

This is one of the first chapters we started overhauling after the demo release, however we struggled to figure out how to make it realisticly connect up to Screams and Whispers, which is why you find a barely updated demo version of the chapter in the mod currently.

I am currently pointing to Zed's recreations of the alpha maps, however whoever is interested in working on these things might find some of the work I did on the chapter a bit useful in terms of upgraded detail.

You can those files in "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a3_alpha" or "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a3\rework"

I know I certainly want the walls from a1a3_1 to be used opposed to the original alpha ones.
