Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Jane\a1a4\a1a4g.jmf"

- I don't recall who, but someone smashed like 3 maps together here. (Not Jane, Jane just it received in this condition.)
	- The map is not supposed to be like this at all. It contains all of a1a4e, a1a4g, and likely what was a1a4f.
	- This map is supposed to be solely the radiation maze. (Alpha\Houndeyes_under.jpg)
- As the certain refers, this was once a maze. It is KINDA a maze in HLAZ, but a very stupid one, I guess more comparable to a switch puzzle.
	- There's supposed to be a few rooms similar to the one you drop down into and you're supposed to figure out where to go and to avoid going into a loop.
		- At least, that's what it seems like out of the minimal photos we have of the map.
- (funny little quake room.png)
	- This room did not exist, at least in this capacity.
	- Was just something Leonel added in from retail c1a4g and flipped upside to try and have some sort of progression in the map.
- The area with the bullsquids (175.jpg) was underneath the radiation maze.
	- I presume this due to the ceiling texture on the room being the floor texture for the radiation maze.
	- Whatever or not it yielded a changelevel is unknown, but I am going to treat it like it did.
	- Unsure on how you actually got to this part though.
