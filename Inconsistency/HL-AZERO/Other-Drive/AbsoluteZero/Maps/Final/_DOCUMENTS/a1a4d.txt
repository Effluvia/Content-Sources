Latest map: You're better off remaking this map.

- This is the Oxy/Fuel map.
- My god, if something could go wrong with a map, it definately went wrong here.
	- You might be able to salvage the fan room.
	- Some of the CRETE section is also seemly right, there was some weird CRETE textured areas just left over on the backsides of these maps.
		- We also have 2 photos of an area that kinda matches up to the design that was found on the backsides.
		- (.\Unknown\Possible C1A4\thlsshot2.jpg) and (.\Unknown\Possible C1A4\thlsshot3.jpg)
	- The sections where the actual Oxy/Fuel valves are is completely incorrect.
		- We have legit no idea where that section truly belonged so we were repurposing it for Screams and Whispers.
		- More likely to be apart of c3a3 or c3a4.
	- If you want to salvage anything, the map can be found here:
	- "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\LeonelC\A1A4 - Screams and Whispers\a1a4e.jmf"
	- You can find an alternative layout that's closer to what I wanted here:
	- "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a4\a1a4e_alt.jmf"
		- However, the latest good shit is in the one in Leonel's folder
		- My layout was also strange and questionable. A middle ground could be possibly found, but who knows.
