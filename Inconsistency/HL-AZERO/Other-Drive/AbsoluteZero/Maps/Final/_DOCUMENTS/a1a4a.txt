Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a4\a1a4b.jmf"

- For some unforseen reason, we made this extremely long and pointless outer silo map.
	- I don't know why, I guess to pad out to match with the 0.61 document? 
		-If that was the case, we clearly didn't fucking read it because its clear the tentacle silo map was c1a4b.
		- Obviously with deduction, you can clearly figure out c1a4a was the inner silo map.
- I added switches outside of each door.
	- This is not how the map originally went. However, it was still different to retail with the doors being open by default.
	- Judging by the retail map sources for Half-Life: Source, it appears the section right before the doors originally led some where. (This section is textured green in HLAZ)
		- This likely was a safety hatch for the outer silo.
		- There would of been no changelevel, so it wouldn't of been too big.
	- From there, it would open up every door to allow the player to enter the Silo.
- Additionally, I think Zed shifted this map off-grid.
	- I know there's definately compile issues with the map now, causing valid collision to the map.
	- I don't know if the map is salvageable, it might need remade from the VMF again.
- The connections to the power puzzle and the oxy/fuel puzzle are kinda poo.
	- I would saw them off and start over on them, maybe taking a little more inspiration from retail than whatever the fuck we were doing.
