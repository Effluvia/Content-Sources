We knew very little on this chapter, however...

We're lucky enough that the chapter was quite litterally 2 maps. While a2a1 got as much media coverage as a1a0, it merely by luck that it was a two map chapter.

Everything else could easily be solved by interpreting the photos and looking at left overs in the HLS map sources.

This is the only other chapter in Half-Life: Absolute Zero that could be considered done. 

There's a few things wrong with it that prevents me from calling it done and putting it in the final folder, but there minor things.
