We do not know much about this chapter, I'm going to say that outright.

Like, we know the chapter was EXTREMELY different, but beyond that, we know like 4-5 maps in-total.

Chapter was longer and was laid out differently.

I won't be doing write ups on maps I have no information on, but I will provide every map name to the original chapter:

c2a2
c2a2a
c2a2b
c2a2c
c2a2d
c2a2e
c2a2f
c2a2g
c2a2h
c2a2i
c2a2j

I also went in-depth on the chapter's design in my personal folder here:
"Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a2a2"
There's also a doc in the root for some reason
"Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours"

However, there's likely conflicting information in these documents as I was writing it as I was researching the maps and working on them.

I can not promise that I agree with all of the documents or maps I made now. I will point to maps I still agree with in these documents opposed to the ones in the personal folder.

There's also tons of leftover visgroups in the VMFs that show cut sections and sometimes what maps were what.

On a Rail was slated to be cut regardless of if things went well or not, we just have so little information to be able to remake the chapter.

This doesn't really fit into any map listing, but is important to mention.
	- The room with the "Yore Dead Freeman" is actually mirrored in retail.
		- It wasn't like that originally in the beta.
