Glock (Silver) - Textures need cleaned up
MP5 - Possibly make new reload, alter reload so it supports both an empty and full clip
RPG - Touch up textures and finish

BareHands - Make it so the HEV is the same the gloved hands use. Make it so every weapon has the bare hands looking good, use other textures when needed.
