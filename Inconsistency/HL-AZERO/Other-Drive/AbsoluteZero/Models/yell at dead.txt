yell at me to remind me to intergrate the varients directly into the main branch stuff instead of having be in external modelsrcs on the BitTorrent Sync

Things that need work:

===WEAPONS===
Grenade - We're using the newer arms for it, the old arms are fucking ruined. Need to fix those back up.
357 - E3 357 would of been the final one, even down to the lack of scope. Issue is, we ship with the scoped 357. Also, Doom needs to port over the real beta 357 and barearms.
	- Could probably just have the MP scope on at all times. Yeah, probably gonna do that.
Chubtoad - I mean, even in the final game this was a red HEV model, probably shouldnt ship an "E3" version.

===MONSTERS===
Controller - Readd the hitbox properties.

Merged over:

===WEAPONS===
Tripmine
Satchel
Snark
Shotgun - The chrome broken on this, needs fixed yo.
RPG
Glock - The Prelim Animations need made, mainly make it 1 handed and port over the alpha shoot also while animating the slide
Gauss - Yes, the E3 one is just the final one. I put the older Orange HEV texture on it tho.
Egon
Crowbar
Crossbow

===MONSTERS===
Chubtoad - Attempted to bring back the variants, decided it was too much of a headache and just decided it wasnt even worth it. The variants are poorly setup.
HAssault - Added in hitbox properties, was missing originally on the SDK model and likely the pre-compiled model.
