ImgLib was born because I needed a standard interface to various image formats, I also
needed the ability to have multi-frame image capability. For multi-frame I chose MNG
because it does not have any licencing issues as GIF does.

MNG support is basic, it will handle MNG files as created by Paint Shop Pro 5. It will
also cope with some of the reference images supplied by the MNG commitee. The latest MNG
specification is available from http://www.hensa.ac.uk/png/mhome/spec. Because PSP5 is the
only tool I coudl find that wrote MNG files and converted GIF to MNG I decided that this was
the best source of MNG reference images. PSP5 does seem to deviate from the spec.

PNG is supported by using the libpng library. Again, it's support is limited but quite functional.

Other formats could be added very easily and ImgLib has been designed to be extended.

To write this library I used several sources.

The first was painlib by Ulrich von Zadow. The general layout of paintlib is nice and easily
extended but it has a lot of MFC baggage that I don't need. paintlib also only has single
frame capability.

I also used ImageMagick by John Cristy, it's homepage is
http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html. I didn't compile this library but just
read the code alongside the painlib code and the MNG spec. It helped a lot and for that I am
greatful.
