Hello, welcome to the demo release of Absolute Zero, after 6 years in development, hopefully it has been worth the wait. We're excited to finally show our work on this mod after our 5 year hiatus of going public, we've changed a lot, even our name is different!

Disclaimer! This mod is a work of fiction, this mod is a recreation of early screenshots of Half-Life, but due to the lack of information on parts we had to improvise and make-up how parts went by using logic of older maps and how we personally see how the maps could fit together. Nothing can be considered to be completely like the beta or can be considered to be how the beta went. So please, do not take this mod as fact!!!

Everything is a Work in Progress, this is just a preview!

Should work on later versions of WON, Pre-Steampipe, and Steampipe versions of the Half-Life client.
