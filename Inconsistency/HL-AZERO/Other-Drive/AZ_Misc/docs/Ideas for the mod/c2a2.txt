Retail c2a2 is purely done for the final layout.

c2a2 is a mix of c2a2g/h the lack of sandbags at the start of the level indicates that the open should open after you complete the rocket puzzle, and using said train to go to c2a3

c2a2a was mostly c2a2b2, the blast doors to the first level of the silo are opened, but the ladder is broken, you have to take the train

c2a2b was c2a2d, the first level of the rocket silo

c2a2c was probably c2a2e, the big area is a duplicated/mirrored version of itself (the two train tracks that spawns a working train with a hgrunt riding it) http://puu.sh/pH6MR/039b8b11ba.png the huge warehouse with the rotating platform should be moved to the top of the rotating lift (probs is that valve made it optional since the player got flanked from everywhere resulting in a unfair fight even on easy) instead of a elevator, add a staircase using the visgrouped ones

c2a2d is the e3 98 tram

c2a2e is the upper loading bay of the second silo floor

c2a2g is the crane puzzle, luring around the laberinth of tracks you have to find a way to move the crane out of the rails

c2a2f is the lift + rail area when the alien slaves vs hecus fight happen, with the upper level with the small office room (propbabilities is that it was a late add, brushwork shows they pasted the foor in it instead of using the older brushes to improve optimization, thing that mappers did a lot of late stages of development) this takes you to c2a2e.

walkthru

The player starts on c2a2, the train you wasted so many hours to get to work gets blocked by a huge blast door, fight your way to the rocket launching room; a scientist opens a door for you that takes you to two elevators, he briefes you about the launching process got caught in the middle of the disaster and the train doors aren't going to open until said rocket gets launched into space, and explains that to make it work you should close the silo doors in order to make the rocket to be finally prepared for launch. 

One of the elevators takes you to the bottom of the rocket silo, the other one is broken and can be only used from it's original position (2nd silo floor).

Taking the elevator it takes you to the bottom of said rocket silo, you can see the emergency ladder that takes you to the various silo levels is broken and can't only be accessible by taking the old rail system.

//Room to silo should have some stukabats hanging from the ceiling

Parting your way to the trains, the only tunnel that leads to the next area is blocked by a crane, the only way to go past through is by finding a way in to the crane control that can be seen in the same room the obstacle is.
Said tunnel takes you to a rotating lift guarded by a pack of soldiers ready to jump at you. 
By barely surviving the ambush, you will notice the same area is the battlefield of what it seems to be another group of HECUs fighting a new foe: the floaters, you can see how the military get's mowed down quickly by poisoning.

After making your way, you will finally reach the blast door of the second floor of the loading bay, it seems that to close the three blast doors you will have to get on a security outpost located on the loading bay of the first floor, so you enter the rocket silo and enter the first floor by going thru the blast door.

From there you can spot a unused train that will ease your way to the security outpost, but seems things aren't going so easy as you tought, the entire place is booby traped with automated sentries, the turrets were set on hostile mode, tripmines are scattered across the place, and on top of that, a soldier brave engouh to hold a apache minigun with his bear arms is guarding the the security outpost and the emergency elevator, the one that didn't worked back on the rocket facility, your only ticket to get back safely. once you go kill the bad guy and close all the silo doors, you take the emergency elevator and go back to the rocket launch room, with the scientist you met earlier waiting your arrival.

You finish what your colleagues didn't, and launch the rocket, once you get back to the train you bringed from Power Up, you will notice both shield doors are opened, and you can move ahead to the next chapter, a abandoned silo.
