\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {The Portal Device is a dimension-spanning gate of unpredictable power, constructed in a decommissioned missile silo.  So far no one has ventured through the Portal, but there has been a steady flow of odd creatures coming to our world.  You are a weapons research scientist who has never touched a weapon\emdash until now.
\par 
\par An accident in the Threshold\rquote s power core fractures the local fabric of spacetime, and hordes of creatures begin spewing into our world through the fissures.  Monsters are everywhere, and your co-workers are dropping like flies.  You head for the surface but the usual routes are unpassable\emdash damaged by the disaster and infested with monsters.  The silo security guards are in a state of primal terror and looking for someone to blame.  The obvious scapegoats are the scientists.  Namely, you. 
\par 
\par In your flight to the surface, you acquire a device which means the difference between victory and annihilation\emdash but you don\rquote t realize whose victory, until too late.  As the Portal experiment\rquote s first human subject, you are cast into the alien world to confront the ultimate horror…to cut off the invasion at its source.  In Half-Life, you won\rquote t just go head-to-head with an alien boss\emdash you will fight it from the inside out.
