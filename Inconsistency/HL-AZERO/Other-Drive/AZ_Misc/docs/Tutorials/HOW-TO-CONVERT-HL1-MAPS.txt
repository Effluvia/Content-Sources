1. Convert .VMF to .MAP, go into the HL2 hammer HL:S preset and change the map format from Half-Life 2 to Half-Life / TFC.

2. Save as c1a0.map (I'll use c1a0 as an example)

3. Make a configuration that uses halflifemerged.wad (you can find it in my textures folder) remember to include decals.wad and liquids.wad

4. Make sure texture locking is enabled.

5. Save the map as a .JMF.

6. Open the map with a normal Half-Life configuration (no halflifemerged.wad)

7. Save again, begin editing!
