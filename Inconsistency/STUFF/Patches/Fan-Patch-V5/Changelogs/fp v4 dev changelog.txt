notes related to the maps that were put together:



general things i did when making the BIG maps:

got rid of the landmarks and changelevels
cut off the middle area to connect the maps
made the player start of the first maps into master
manually updated missaligned origin for func_pushable, momentary_door etc.
alligned textures where needed
deleted unnecessary env_fog_controller(s), water_lod_control(s) etc.
deleted/changed world geometry
deleted global entity connections
renamed things
made some func_detail into world geo
made some world geo into func_detail
combined certain entities
set proper worldspawn settings
changed prev/next map trigger_changelevel(s) so that they would connect
