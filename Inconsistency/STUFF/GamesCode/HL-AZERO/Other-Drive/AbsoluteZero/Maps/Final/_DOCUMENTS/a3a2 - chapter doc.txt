This is one of those chapters where we were like "we'll come back around to it after we're done with the rest."

It is not necessarily hard, kinda just the same old, same old. Alpha chapter itself wasn't too different from the beta or even retail chapter. 

It appears this chapter was in-fact longer than the original, while it has the same amount of maps as the final chapter, you have to remember that the last few maps in the file listing are late additions.

Therefore, retail c3a2e and c3a2f were not in the beta, but were rather maps that went after c3a2d.

How exactly that went is beyond me, we never did any deep research on this chapter beyond the first three maps. 

We wanted to swing back around after we finished the rest of the mod and obviously, since you're reading this, that didn't happen.
