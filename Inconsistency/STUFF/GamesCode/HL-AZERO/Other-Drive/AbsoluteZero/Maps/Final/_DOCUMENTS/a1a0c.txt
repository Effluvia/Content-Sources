Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Final\A1A0 - The Portal Device\a1a0c.jmf"

- There was once an escort puzzle in this map, even likely during the beta stages of the game's development.
	- There's a photo (C1a0_early07.jpg) that depicts a Scientist being in the one room adjacent to the GMan room.
	- We once had an escort puzzle here, where you had to take the Scientist to the doors to progress. But due to the way the map is (destruction everywhere,) his pathing would fail and the puzzle would be pretty frustrating to finish.
	- It is also heavily implied that the destroyed doors where always there in that room, considering the airlock is a nearly direct copy from the old alpha version of the chapter.
	- So who knows what the Scientist's purpose was, if there was even one. Valve could of just put him there as a set piece and nothing more, and playtesters likely got confused on why he was there and so Valve removed him because of it.
