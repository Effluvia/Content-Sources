Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Jane\a1a4\a1a4g.jmf"

- This document is based upon the perception of the bullsquids room (175.jpg) is seperated by a changelevel.
- Beyond that, I actually don't know how this map went.
	- Clearly you end up going through a pipe to end up in the real a1a4g.
	- I personally find the way Jane implemented the connection to be kinda hacky, but considering the entire map was hacked together when she got it, she did what she could.
	- It is possible that some of the pipe sections from retail were originally under the silo.
		- But that's nothing more than a guess.
- It is possible that this unknown section (canisters.png) was originally part of this map, but it very much could be anywhere.
	- It's possible it could of been the room before you got on the tram ride to the silo, it could be under the silo, and it could even belong to a1a1.
	- We're betting on it being under the silo, but we truly don't know ourselves.
