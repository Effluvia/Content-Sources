Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a2\rework\zed\a1a2c.jmf"

- Grind my teeth when I look at this map.
- For starters...
	- If you see any missing texture in this map, it is because Zed is still using a depercated WAD file that we got rid of YEARS ago.
		- We have told him to stop using it countless times, he clearly hasn't.
	- I told Zed to not add in the doors to the freezer from the alpha and I purposely did not re-include them.
		- He readded them and also textured them with the depercated WAD!
		- "why why why why why why why why why why why why.png"
	- In the freezer, there's a puzzle where you're supposed to escort two boxes (one medium, one small) to get into a vent.
		- I told Zed to add in the small box, he added another medium box.
		- If you break the tiny boxes, you will softlock yourself.
		- remove this box and put a small box some where in the freezer.
		- "pointless box.png"
	- In the area where you're supposed to get to the other side via an office's vent, there are a set of doors.
		- Ignoring the obvious fact they're rotated the wrong way so you could literally just WALK through them.
		- They're also not on the right wall that they were in the alpha.
		- They look out of place now because of it. They were fine even in the HLAZ demo.
		- "wrong door placement.png" is how it is in this map.
		- "right-ish door placement.png" is how it is in the alpha.
			- Yes, the rotation is wrong there too, but there was another set of doors that prevented the players to get to this hallway.
			- We got rid of those doors, therefore these doors need to prevent the player from progressing that way.
	- There's a puzzle that requires you to walk above the cafeteria.
		- At first, I was for keeping this puzzle into the mod.
			- But after time, I realized that putting the doors in like the alpha (the ones we removed) would not fit in the retail/beta style of doors.
			- So I decided that it would be best to cut this puzzle and just have the player exit the vent directly at the end of the hallway.
			- I told Zed this and he decided he didn't want to do that.
			- "get rid of this puzzle.png"
			- Make it so there's no vent or dip on the side you enter and restore the alpha style beams just as a style thing you can see when Headcrabs bust through the ceiling.
			- "you know, these beams.png"
			- "come out of this vent.png"
- Enough of things Zed did that inflict genuine anger and migraines.
- In the boxart area of the map, there's a hallway that currently leads no where.
	- You can see on the boxart of the game that is curves out to some where.
	- We genuinely have no idea what is supposed to be here.
	- "this is supposed to go some where.png"
	- A Zed moment however... Remove the fucking Panthereye! He does NOT work well in tight areas and blue had to hack the code to make it so he worked better in the random areas you tossed him.
- The doors are missing to the atrium room and the connection from the boxart area to the caferteria.
	- I fucking HATE the wooden door texture Valve made, and it seems Valve did too as they didn't really use it anywhere.
	- I would replace them with the silver window doors that are heavily used in a1a2b.
- The connection from the box puzzle to the cafeteria is a bit forced.
	- Unsure if you could make something that isn't too forced.
- The restroom door should be a green door and not a wooden one.
	- It was once accessable, but Zed undid that.
	- I vaguely recall telling him to remove it as we wouldn't be able to add a proper mirror in there. So I'm not going to chalk that one up to some strange Zed thing, it's likely more on me.
	- If someone does choose to leave it unaccessable, please leave the flooded room gag in. Thanks! :)
- The changelevel to a1a2d is way too far up, bring it down a little.
