- This map is mostly fine, just some minor things.
- Wooden plank in the pipe was likely not there originally.
	- You likely spun the valve and flooded it so you could swim down.
- You originally were able to get on the sides of the cliffs.
	- From there you would of been able to access the pipe you flooded.
		- I guess via a broken ladder or something else.
- (no slant and textured incorrectly, if there's more like this, then its needs to match the rest.png)
	- There's other unlevel parts of the map, if they don't match up (such as the photo, those do not match up) then they need corrected.
