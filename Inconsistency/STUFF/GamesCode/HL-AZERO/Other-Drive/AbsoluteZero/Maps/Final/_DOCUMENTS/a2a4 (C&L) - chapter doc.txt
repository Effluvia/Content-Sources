Zed jank!

This chapter contains non-sensical Zed jank, proceed with caution.

Beyond two maps, you probably want to take the original HLS VMFs and work from there.

I might have the HLS maps fixed up for HL1 in my personal folder, but I might of only did some of the maps and not all of them.

As for documentation for this map.

All of the documentation points to two maps being mostly the same, but other maps are completely unknown.

Also, strange as it sounds, reference the Chutes and Ladders board game for ideas on the chapter was supposed to go.

Why? Because the chapter is LITERALLY named after that board game because it was directly inspired by it.
