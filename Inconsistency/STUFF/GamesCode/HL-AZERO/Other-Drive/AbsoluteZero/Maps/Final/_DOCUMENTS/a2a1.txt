Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\LeonelC\A2A1 - Footfall\a2a1.jmf"

- The bit that led from a1a4j is missing, meaning you can only start this chapter from console.
	- When we did this chapter originally, we had no idea how Screams and Whispers went.
		- Only as time progressed we figured out this map was basically untouched.
	- The original connection we had in the map was god awful and also didn't work because the water level wasn't high enough to leave the pipe anyway.
		- Regardless, you would of been stuck at a1a4g and a2a1.
			- Don't know why people take the hint that they should stop playing because the mod is unfinished and was in-active development.
			- But people kept thinking the mod was fully complete and playable despite it saying on the store page it wasn't, the discussions said it wasn't, and there was build text on the screen at all times telling you it isn't finished.
				- I guess the same question apply to those who wondered why it was just Half-Life again. Reading is very important and I guess illiteracy is rampant.
- You can not turn on power in the map.
- There's no barricade of trash preventing players from walking over to On a Rail.
	- There's an extremely old photo of Footfall that shows a wall with a crate texture.
		- I don't want that, but having it be blocked up by wooden crates and other shit would be nice.
- A ladder is missing a brush on a corner. Don't know how that happened.
- The area with the HGrunt being dragged though the wall is lacking any lighting, you legit can't see what the fuck is going on in there.
