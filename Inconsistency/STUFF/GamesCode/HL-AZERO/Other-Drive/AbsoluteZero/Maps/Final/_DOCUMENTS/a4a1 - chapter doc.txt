Gonna say it here, Xen was mostly going to be Interloper. Seriously, we were just going to condense Xen down to Interloper, it appears that's what Valve had the chapter as.

To be fair, Interloper is probably the best designed parts of Xen in-general. Minus c4a1a, that map can go suck one, same with c4a1 itself. Most other Interloper maps were good.

We would of kept these maps:
c4a1b
c4a1c
c4a1d
c4a1e
c4a1f
and obviously the two cut Interloper maps found among the HLS VMFs.

The order of the maps may of been different, and we would of obviously attempted to recreate the concept art we have. 

Gonarch's Lair likely would of made a return, but not exactly as it was in retail.

You would of fought against Nihilanth, but it would of been more akin to its concept form instead of the hastly thrown together Controller clone we have in the game today.

The arena that you fought against him in would also been vastly different too.

We genuinely had basically no information on the chapter beyond very late development stuff and even then, that info was minimal too.
