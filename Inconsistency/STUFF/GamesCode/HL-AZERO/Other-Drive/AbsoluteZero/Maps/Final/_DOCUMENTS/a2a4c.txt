Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Captain Zed\A2A4 - Questionable Ethics\a2a4c.jmf"

- Map is mostly fine, but there are some very glaring issues.
	- We never fully finished converting this map from Half-Life: Source, so certain entities and texture alignments are busted.
- (water is too high.png)
	- We raised the water level thinking that's what Valve had it at.
		- We later discovered a rare image of this section show the water level was no different from retail. Fun.
- (implemented poorly.png)
	- anything past the crusher in retail Chutes and Ladders was not original to the map, I recall them being in a completely different visgroup from the rest of the map.
	- We saw this section in On a Rail and thought it would of been a perfect contender for a replacement end.
		- We were WRONG.
		- I don't know if it is because of how Zed implemented it or if it was just a bad idea from the start, but it just does not work.
	- A new ending to this map needs to be figured out.
