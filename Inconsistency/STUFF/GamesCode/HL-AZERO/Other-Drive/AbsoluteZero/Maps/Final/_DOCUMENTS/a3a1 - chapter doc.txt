I was working on redoing this entire chapter. This was one of the first I was working on redoing as the one we had been using was REALLY corrupted.

I don't know how the water became solid, nor do I know how Barney crashes the game. I don't really care either, the old chapter was an insane mess.

Why I kept forcing a fucking warehouse into the chapter is beyond me, I guess because Uplink had one?

Not a single version of that fucking warehouse was even good. Took me several years to realize "wait we don't have to put a warehouse in the chapter."

Leonel wanted to snap my neck when I realized that as I am sure he had been telling me for the past several years to not have a fucking warehouse.

The Arizona Warehouses.

We also have some documentation for this chapter in here:
