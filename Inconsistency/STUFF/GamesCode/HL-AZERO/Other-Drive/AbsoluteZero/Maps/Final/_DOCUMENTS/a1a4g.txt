Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Jane\a1a4\a1a4g.jmf"

- This is the section where you run into a valve that does not spin right.
	- You know the section...
	- In this map, that actually functions.
- Tunnel did not lead to the pipe section to lead you to Footfall.
	- Unknown on where it would of taken you.
- Retail's c1a4g is clearly several maps hacked together.
	- You have bits that originally belonged to a1a4g, but you also have sections unrelated, like the connection to Footfall.
		- That connection to Footfall was likely apart of a1a4i originally.
	- Where the underwater section or the connection to Footfall belonged original is beyond me.
		- They clearly existed at some point, but Valve just slammed a bunch of maps together to make a new under silo section.
- We have the blueprints to this map.

	- It doesn't tell us much, beyond the section we recreated and what map it originally was.
