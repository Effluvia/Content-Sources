Likewise with "We've Got Hostiles," we decided to go with Alien Research Lab opposed to beta Questionable Ethics.

We have very little on beta Questionable Ethics, but the info we do have on it does imply that it was just a condensed version of the final chapter with different textures.

With Alien Research Lab, we just have the original alpha chapter on hand, so we can easily base upon it.

A thing to note, a little birdy told me that you might of fought against FAssassins in this chapter and one would of jumped through the hole in the cliff in the first map to introduce the player to the FAssassins.
