Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a2a2\working\a2a2_unknown.jmf"
and also parts of c2a2b2

- You likely came out of the elevator in c2a2b2 and walked to the rocket silo bit.
	- (I didn't exist.bmp)
		- This section likely didn't exist considering the two sections seperated by it are just the same room but mirrored.
		- I recreated what I had in mind for this area, but I must of deleted it because I ran into other things that made literally no sense.
- Going out of the area like in retail would take you to the map I am pointing to.
	- It likely connected up similarly to how the outside section connects to a2a2.
- Beyond this, I have no idea how else this map went.
	- We only have a photo of this little turn section, and its remains in retail is just a sliver of it.

		- The whole map and sister maps were just outright removed from the game.
		- It is also possible that this took place some where else in the chapter, but we literally have no information on this map.
