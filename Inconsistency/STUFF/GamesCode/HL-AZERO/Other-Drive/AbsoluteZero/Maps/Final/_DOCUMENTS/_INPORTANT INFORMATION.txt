Most documents may or may not contain information, and some may be outright missing.

Believe it or not, there are maps we don't know anything about. Even to the point where we can't even make estimates on what they could of been.

The "chapter doc" files will do their best to condense the chapter as a whole while giving out some documentation for how they would of went; even if certain maps are undocumented.

Typically I will go in-depth about certain maps to the best of my ability in their proper map document. I will also point to the latest HLAZ map assuming there is one or if the map isn't beyond salvageable.

Also, every time you see a model cast a shadow in a pre-release screenshot, you gain the information on how the map was originally rotated. Model shadows are not affected by light, they're just the model squished down.

If you see a photo referenced and its not in a folder of the matching map name, refer to the Photos folder in the BitTorrent Sync directory.

I do not provide the leaked Half-Life: Source VMFs from 2003 in any of these files, please contact your local leak supplier to gain access to those.

Obviously, there's some general stuff that applies to every map. Like autosaves, clipping, general clean up, visgrouping, ambient sounds, null faces, etc. 

I'm not going out of my way to say this about every map, just have it be known that every map needs stuff like that.

Valve was not too big of using slopes, typically slopes were added in when Valve started to hack together maps.

I refer to this 0.61 document a lot. You can find it in: "BitTorrent Sync\AZ_Misc\docs\Alpha-0.61\"

If a map is missing a dedicated document, then we don't have a good grasp on the map and we don't have a map to work from. 

You should be able to find some maps with the names of the missing maps, but those maps are not at all close to what we would actually want in-game. Thus why they go undocumented.
