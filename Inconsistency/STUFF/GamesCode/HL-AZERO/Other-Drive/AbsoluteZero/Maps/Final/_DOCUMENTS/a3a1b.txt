Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a3a1\rework\a3a1b.jmf"

- We never added gameplay to this map.
	- I don't think I ever came up with new gameplay for this map as the room that leads to the satalite dish was still locked off with beams.
	- The security guard also would still trigger the turrets to gun you down, as well.
	- The HGrunts, HAssaults, and FAssasins would also ambush you as you tried to exit after tuning the satalite dish.
- The briefing room (the one with sat globe) was never added into the map.
	- I wanted it to be more align to the alpha one, but still containing some of the additions from the repurposed version in retail On a Rail.
		- Such as the textures and the SatGlobe.
- There's a little room that could contain the elevator back to a3a1, but I don't think its rotation was right for the elevator, or the elevator colided with a wall.
	- Find purpose for that room as it seems to have been in the original map.
