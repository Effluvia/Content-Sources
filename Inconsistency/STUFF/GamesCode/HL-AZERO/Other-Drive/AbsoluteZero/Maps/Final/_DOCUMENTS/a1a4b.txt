- I recall the Safety Hatch light being broken.
	- It should be on by default, then when you climb up to the top to open every door in the silo, the light should turn off.
		- I recall defeating the tentacle and seeing the light on with every other light, this is not how that's supposed to be.
	- It is up to interpretation on whatever or not the explosion button would of caused an override on the Safety Hatch. It might of only caused the room you were to close up.
- Door should not take fucking forever to open if you go the route of retail.
	- I think we had some deep debate over whatever or not this door should be affected by the Safety Hatch, but I don't think we ever came up with an agreement.
	- But Leonel made the door extremely slow, while I recall myself wanting this options of have two choices on what path you could take to enter the silo.
	- It is all down to a matter of opinion and interpretation. But I did not like it this way.
- You should probably restore the back wall the Scientist crashes into back to the retail/beta one.
	- We changed it to the one found in 3DSMax files, but I just don't think it looks as good.
- In the concept art for Screams and Whispers the tentacles would of been able to smash the floors you walked on.

	- I highly doubt Valve ever had this in-game, we have blue prints of the map but it is so low resolution that you can't make out anything beyond that they were using yellow walls.
	- While I doubt Valve ever had this in-game, I did actually want to see this detail added in-game.
- The little platform we have for the safety hatch was nothing more than a placeholder to be able to access it during gameplay.
	- There's no clear shot of it, beyond the fact you can see it existed. Could of also been a placeholder when Valve added it too.

- When you get under the silo with all of the abandoned garbage, you're still supposed to find a security guard and his Python.
