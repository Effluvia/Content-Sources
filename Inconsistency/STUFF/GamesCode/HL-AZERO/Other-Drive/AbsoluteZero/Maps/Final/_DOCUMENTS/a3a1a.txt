Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a3a1\rework\a3a1a_helipad.jmf"

- Gameplay is not in these maps yet.
- I do not like the connection I was making to the building to the helipad.
	- That shit was forced as fuck.
	- Perhaps refer to Uplink to what should be put there.
		- Maybe a warehouse. :v)
- Don't panic, I just have most of the visgroups turned off.
	- Did that so I could see various connections and work on isolated areas easier.
- Opening sewer section is missing.
	- Reference the alpha a little, you probably could also just salvage what was in retail.
- (oops i removed the lights in the ceiling.png)
- The pipe that leads to the surface ends prematurely.
	- I didn't know how I wanted the ladders and pipe connections to be in the map.
- You could mimic the section from Uplink outside of the building where the HGrunts are parked.
	- For example: just kill them off and have a Scientist tell you to wait a moment and unlock the doors.
	- You could also add in the TNT to blow the fuck out of the doors.
	- The door shouldn't be a garage door, should be one of those LAB doors. The one used in Uplink, for example.
- The room beyond that, I don't know how that would of connected to the helipad. The current design in a3a1a_helipad is kinda shit and forced.
	- I just needed an idea and I didn't like that one.
- The elevator connection back to a3a1 is also forced.
	- I don't even remember if it even is the right rotation for it.
- The connection to Datacore was never finished either.
- Beyond that, the unfinished bits, and cleaning up the map, the map was pretty good.
