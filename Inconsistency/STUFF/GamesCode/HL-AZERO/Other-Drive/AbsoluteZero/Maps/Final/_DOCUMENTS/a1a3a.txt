Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Captain Zed\A1A3 - We've Got Hostiles\rework\c1a3b_alpha_recreated.jmf"

- This map did not change much beyond a different map name if the 0.61 game doc is to be assumed to be Security Complex.
- One of the only things to change is that there's a bunch of tables stacked up in the blue room.

	- I believe the tables are correct in "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a3_alpha\a1a3_2.jmf"
