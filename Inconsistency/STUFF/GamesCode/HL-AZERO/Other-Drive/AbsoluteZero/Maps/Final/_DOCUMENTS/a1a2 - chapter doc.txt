We know so much and so little about this chapter.

We know enough to be able to interpret what Valve meant from c1a2a to c1a2d, but there's still a lot of blanks that need to be filled in.

We don't know how c1a2 itself worked beyond 3 screenshots of the map.

Much like a1a1, I provide a bunch of documentation with-in "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a2\rework"
