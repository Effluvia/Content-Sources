- If the 0.61 document is to be trusted on being Security Complex during this era, then Valve had combined together c1a3 and c1a3a before they had cut the chapter.
- Additionally, there were some major changes they did to the main area where you get off of the elevator.
	- There's no longer two floors to the map, the connection to c1a3a was now on the base level.
	- The connection to Screams and Whispers was no longer in this map, but was likely in the final map of this chapter.
	- The design was also different due to them cutting the second floor of the map, you can see its new design in (Alpha\188.jpg)
	- The rest of the map is unknown to what was changed post-0.52 alpha.
	- While the walls to the later half are still the alpha style walls seen in c1a3a (Alpha\b4.jpg) 
		- The redesigned wall style I did in "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a3_alpha\a1a3_1.jmf" matches up more with the beta aesthetic, and should be used.
- The vent puzzles in this map were much different than what actually shipped with the alpha.
	- We have a left over updated sign texture depicting a change with the puzzle.
	- Would of likely been closer to the vent puzzle seen in retail c1a3.
