Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a1\rework\a1a1.jmf"

- As I stated in the general doc for this chapter, it is fully possible that our a1a1 and a1a1a were just one map in the alpha, and that our a1a0c was just a1a1.
- Regardless of if that was the case, the retail version of this map is forced together with the connection from the starting room to the room where the houndeyes bust out of the window.
	- I'll go a little more in-depth on that in the next document. Maybe not the forced together part, that's just hard for me to describe beyond "look at it."
- If it was originally split off into 2 maps, then I genuinely have no idea how the two maps would of connected. 
	- It is very much possible that the nonlinear idea of the alpha still lasted into the beta. It does seem that way with the cut off sewers in the mainbridge map.
