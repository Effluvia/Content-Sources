Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\LeonelC\A3A1 - You're On Your Own\a3a1.jmf"

- Map is one of the few things that didn't end up being corrupted to hell, might actually be salvageable.
	- Returning to the map from the elevator does cause it to fuck up a little.
	- Also, we made the elevator sequence before it was possible to decompile PS2 maps.
		- We wanted it to mimic the PS2 Office Complex opening.
- Also, I am sick of seeing TNNL.
	- Maybe revert to retail's texturing or something similar to it.
	- Perhaps even make a new texture.

	- This section has always bothered me.
	- On the wall with the door, I would put in the alpha elevator you access to get to the sewers.
		- The section where that elevator was is now a fan. Would be easy to just move it over.
