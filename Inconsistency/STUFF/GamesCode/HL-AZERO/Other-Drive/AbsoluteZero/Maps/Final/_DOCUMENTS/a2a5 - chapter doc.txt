Ah yes, Cliff Hanger. The chapter that almost was Milestone 1!

We got halfway through the chapter before the person who was working on it basically ran out of steam.

Since this was outsourced, we actually already had detailed documentation for this chapter. I'm going to straight up point you to those files, will talk about the JMF themselves in these documents.

We're lucky enough to know the first half mostly, even the pre-December 97/pre-dam era of it.

Basically, when boot camp was still in the chapter, it was basically just a different a2a5. It appears the rest of the chapter was just the same as it was in the beta.

I am going to document that version of the map for anyone who may want to recreate it.

As for the desert section of this chapter, that was actually not apart of the chapter originally.

Those were apart of a sub-campaign that was made for fun by Valve. It was called Geo.

Out of Geo, only 2 of the maps made it in-game. The other two were cut. Luckily, we actually have the concept art for Geo, it is oftenly confused for the concept art for Boot Camp or Military Camp.
