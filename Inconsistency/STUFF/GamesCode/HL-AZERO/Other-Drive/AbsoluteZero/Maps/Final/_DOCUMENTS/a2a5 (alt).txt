While we do have a boot camp base, it was just us trying to have fun in making a longer Cliff Hanger instead of an accurate one. 
Brushwork could be lifted from it, but Leonel did some strange changes to the tops of buildings and I am not sure at all how correct the rotation of the map is in-relation to the original.
Can be found here:
"Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\LeonelC\A2A5 - Military Camp\Coolz' Branch\bootcamp.jmf"
This is the only official map Coolz made or worked on.

Anyway...

- We have the concept art for this map.
	- (Cabal_surface2.png)
		- Can someone throw more shit ontop the concept? I don't want to see my level concept, just misc shit.
- Basically, you exited from the alpha version of Question Ethics.
- From there, you ended up in boot camp.
- You would progress from boot camp to some pipe and end up on cliffside (a2a5a)
- The rest of the chapter was seemly the same.
