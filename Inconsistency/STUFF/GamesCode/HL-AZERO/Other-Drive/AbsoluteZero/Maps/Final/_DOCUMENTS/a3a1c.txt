Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Captain Zed\A3A1 - You're On Your Own\a3a1d.jmf"

- In 0.61 document, this map is refered to being a3a1b.
	- I'm not too sure how that would of worked since I'm decently confident on the previous maps layout.
	- It could be a weird situation where datacore ended up being a3a1c as they were remaking it and just slapped it at the end of the map list.
		- It is what Valve did with tons of other chapters, so I wouldn't put it past them.
- Rotation should match up a3a1b and everything should still work.
