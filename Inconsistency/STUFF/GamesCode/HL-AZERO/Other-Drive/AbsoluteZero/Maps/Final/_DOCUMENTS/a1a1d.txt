Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a1\rework\zed\a1a1d.jmf"

- I explictily told Zed to fix the rotation of the map before he started working on the map.
	- He didn't.
	- Rotation is supposed to match up with a1a1e, the hallway that currently contains the elevator is also supposed to match up with a1a1d, even down to the room connection.
- Additionally, those bridges that connect the two sides were supposed to be narrow.
	- I started trying to use the E3 style brdiges, but they did not fit well, told Zed to commit to the earlier style.
	- He didn't. Nor did he intergrate it into the middle piece like the bridge that comes from a1a1b does.
- Once you get into this map from a1a1c, you'll have access to be able to progress to a1a1e.
	- If you come directly from a1a1b, you won't be able to do anything beyond shooting monsters and breaking crates.
- There's supposed to be a lift in this map, you can see something that looks to be a lift in Dank and Scud.
	- We don't know what its purpose was beyond messing around with crates.
- You can see two accessable rooms on both ends of the rails.
	- What were in these are a mystery. One likely led into the room that the lift goes to.
- The sewers from the previous map likely led into this map too.
	- In the Dank and Scud comics you can see a walkable path where the water in.
	- Also appears to be an opening in the side with the 17 hallway.
- Only hallways that existed here are the paths to a1a1e and a1a1b
	- The one from a1a1b is actually curved, even in the earlier design.
	- There was no third path like there is in the demo HLAZ chapter.
	- Looking closely at the Dank and Scud comic, it appears to just be a blank wall over there.
- The 17 Hallway led into the section where the Alpha chapter stops containing maps.
	- So we have no idea how exactly a1a1e went.
	- We know it led into Office Warens without an elevator, but beyond that and how it looks, we don't know.
	- The changelevel from a1a1d to a1a1e happens around the same area it does in the alpha. Go through the doors and the changelevel happens.
