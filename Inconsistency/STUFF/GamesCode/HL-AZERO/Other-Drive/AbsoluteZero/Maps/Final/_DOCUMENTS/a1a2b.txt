Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a2\rework\zed\a1a2b.jmf"

- The transition room to go into the window area is not really all that detailed.
	- I originally moved a map that was added in around E3 and is still in retail into that section, but Zed cut it out and moved it elsewhere.
- I retextured the maintence access to fit more in-align with the rest of the areas in Office Warens, but Zed ended up making one of the brushes textured in-correctly, somehow.
	- seen in "texture issue.png"
	- Either someone can commit to what I was changing it too, or someone can revert it back to ~real beta~.
- Storage room was likely more akin to the little storage closet found in retail's c1a2, minus the zombie busting through the door.
	- Could of also been somewhat similar to the office you get into from the same vent from retail. Possibly a hybrid between the two.
- Changelevel from a1a2a should be in the same placement as retail
	- I don't know if Zed corrected this or not.
