Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a1\rework\a1a1b.jmf"

- Map played out similarly to the alien prison map in the alpha.
	- If you actually take a look at the two maps, you can realize that this is just a recreation of that map but made it make a little more sense to the world and design of HL.
	- Our recreation of the alpha map is located here: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Captain Zed\A1A1 - Unforeseen Consequences\rework stuff\c1a1a_alpha.jmf"
- Sewer section likely played out similarlly to the alpha, the "18" hallway could of led into this section where you interacted with the sewers or whatever.
	- Rotations of the maps forbid the threeway bridge map to be able to directly connect up to mainbridge. Along with the design of the hallway in threeway.
	- The concept of this room could of also been lifted from Akira as well.
	- This room would lead to threeway as well, but it would of been a deadend. During E3, the main bridge would of been broken just like in retail.
	- That forward path is not the path you want to take to threeway, as the generator is not on for the boxes to be moved or for the blast doors to be unlocked.
	- This changelevel connection would of led to a1a1d.
- You want to jump down off of the bridge and go to the box puzzle (a1a1c) to get to threeway (a1a1d.)
- Some where in this map there would of been a Pantheye vs Scientist sequence.
	- if not this map, then a1a1a (assuming a1a0c was a1a1.)
