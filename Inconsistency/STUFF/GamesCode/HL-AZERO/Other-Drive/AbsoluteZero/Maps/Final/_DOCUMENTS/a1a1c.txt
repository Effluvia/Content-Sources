Latest map: "Dropbox\AbsoluteZero\Maps\Ours\Theuaredead\a1a1\rework\zed\a1a1c.jmf"

- Zed fucked up the texuring on the hallway to get in the room.
	- Should not be textured differently from the rest of the floor. Should be a consistent "-0SILO2_P2" across the entire floor.
	- He likely interpreted my unfinished map as how I wanted the floor, but the reality is, I just hadn't touched that section of the map.
		- I did fuck up the ceiling height on that map and I told him to absolutely not copy that. He didn't to my knowledge.
- Zed simplified the stair case to the generator room, shouldn't be slopes, should be like the alpha.
	- The L shaped hallway is horrible. two doors in a tiny hallway like that is a big no-no.
	- There should be a more direct connection to the generator room from that hallway.
	- Also, floor should be "-0SILO2_P2" if you had guessed.
- You turn on the switch in the one room, which will turn on the big ol' gearshaft generator.
	- This will make way to the box moving.
- That grunt is a placeholder for checking shadow rotations of the map.
	- He's in several photos of this area, but HGrunts were Valve's defacto placeholder NPC.
	- Valve didn't use them to test rotations of maps, they used them as they were the most finished AI out of all of enemies in-game.
- This map some how connects into a1a1d
	- You're supposed to ride that box into a1a1d, however, I'm not even sure how you would of been able to jump onto it.
	- From there, the rails would be a changelevel to a1a1d.
		- Just want to state, and I will state this in the next document too. a1a1d is currently on the wrong rotation, it needs to be fixed before anything could be done with it.
