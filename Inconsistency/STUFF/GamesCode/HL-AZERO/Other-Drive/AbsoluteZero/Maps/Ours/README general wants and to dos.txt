GENERAL

- Make test maps for each scripted event found in files and models
	- Why? So we can have each sequence in a useable state and so we can figure out where they all belong and can be added in.

- Make a map file with prefabs and generally reused parts of maps.
	- Make sure everything is nicely made and has special details (I enjoy spinny chairs and interactive trash cans :shrug:)

- Go through textures and remake prefabs we only have textures for

- Make test maps for squences we know nothing about
	- There's serveral signs in-game that explain shit that isn't in-game!

- Study the shadows on various screenshots, shadows determin rotations of the maps. This is to make sure that all of our areas are rotated correctly or put in the right place.

GENERAL TERMS
- Develop
	- Chapter is not playable and parts are missing
- General Polish
	- Check the maps for errors and make sure everything is up to snuff with our current style and our current skill level
- Medium Reworks
	- Layouts may conflict with what the alpha 0.61 document explains about the chapter or from the shadow rotations. Nothing majorly, most work can be re-used.
- Heavy Polish
	- Very broken or unfinished maps, odds are high these are using my old 2013 map converts
- Heavy Reworks
	- Maps will likely need to be restarted or be heavily modified.
- Original Maps
	- Refers to how they're documented in the alpha 0.61 document, will likely have more info added on to relate to other forms of documents of maps.

A1A0

- General polish
- Original maps:
	- c1a0 — starting level, lab
	- c1a0a — lab before it blows
	- c1a0b — blown up lab
	- c1a0c — ditto
- Area with the lasers didn't exist, and I wouldn't be surprised if the room before the control room didn't exist due to it being a mirror of the room after the control room.

A1A1

- General polish and Medium Reworks
- Original maps:
	- c1a1
	- c1a1a — passages and lots of headcrabs
	- c1a1b — elevator with headcrabs dropping on you, lots of watery passages.  
	- c1a1c — room with grinding gears and crate conveyor
	- c1a1d — move and break boxes with weapons/lift.
	- c1a1e

A1A2

- General polish and Medium Reworks
- Shorten hallway to zombie fight
- Original maps:
	- c1a2 — hang (my note: likely crashes the game in 0.61 or earlier?)
	- c1a2a — fun in offices with scientists and headcrabs.
	- c1a2b — ditto
	- c1a2c — freezer with slippery ice.
	- c1a2d — try and jump/climp up ladder. It’s a bitch.

A1A3

- General polish
	Remake changelevel from a1a3 to a1a3a ITS BAD
	Change enemy position of a1a3a's starting room so they are on the elevated terrain/metal platforms
	a1a3c - remake the mortar table from c2a5 and put it on the "campus" outside of the storage area, once you kill the grunt operating it, the mortars will stop shooting
	a1a3 - make security outpost's door to open (ez to do)
- Original maps:
	- c1a3 — welcome to your first mini-gun
	- c1a3a — vents and mini-guns
	- c1a3b — phlegm-shooters and crabs. Nice.
	- c1a3c — CRASH
//Alpha maps

A1A4

- Heavy reworks and heavy polishing
	Better connection from a1a4 to a1a4a (feels empty and boring)
	Toss more details on a1a4a - Pipes either working or broken with spilling radioactive stuff
	Fix lift's button so it doesn't feel wierd to use (move to side of lift)
	Better textures on room where the lift arrives
	Please make proper entity work for a1a4b's changelevels
	One of the entrances to the silo lacks proper lighting
	Big room in front of the open door to get into a1a4i doesn't have any purpose (slap room with "THIS IS MY HIDING SPOT" scientist?)
	A1A4I is a mess of faulty entity work
		Revert back e3 ladder (the fuck zed?)
	Just get rid of the barneys on top, they weren't on e3 and the barney that's supposed to get killed doesn't die
	Think of something about the platforms the player haves to jump around (the gap is almost reachable if you know how to circle strafe jump)
		Safety Catch was probably a gimmick to show off the hatch is open and the fire will go out with no issues, so make the lever broken and turn the platforming section a secret to get health and armor
	Again, better scripting work for changelevels PLEASE
	A1A4C is fine, it just needs tweaking and some brushwork so it makes sense
		Make the hall leading to the place shorter OR JUST GET RID OF IT
		crates for the puzzle shit once the current goes back should be on the other side (it's useless as it is)
		Water puddle near the entrance to the generator should take all the place, instead of being spotty as it is to force the player to use the crates
		I don't know what's going on with the vents on the room with the machines but PLEASE do something about it
		Same with the hooks, take those away, they don't make any sense anymore
		IMPROVE THAT LIFT FOR CHRISTS SAKE
		IMPROVE THOSE BIG DOORS ON THE GENERATOR SILO JESUS ZED
			Toss a balcony or some shit and let the stukabats hang/rest there
			Lighting should be more spotty and less "fill the whole area with a tint"
	A1A4D - I don't even know anymore
		Fix textures
		Make the entrance to the Fan like on the cabal, why is it so hard to fOLLOW THE CABALAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
			Platform with zombies should be optional, toss loot and goodies, you know the deal
			Place bundles of pushable canisters on each platform to prevent the player of running out of opportunities to miss it
				Tweak the trigger_pushes so they don't push the stuff on the platforms
		Make the fan smaller, I don't know why valve designed it like that and it's even worse on AZ because the ladder climbing speed is slow
		Make the room with the oxy/fuel tanks less boxy and toss the pipes like the cabal does, I REALLY hate how the retail stuff is there, it makes us look lazy as fuck
			Make it have rotating valves and shit, make it cool, interesting, WORTH PLAYING
			Don't use panthereyes as aggresive npcs, they AREN'T AGGRESIVE, they sneak on the player and attack from behind or when low HP
			Add smooth corners or something interesting on the locked hall, it's plain as shit
	A1A4G - It's there, I guess
		Make it so as soon as the player reaches the room on a1a4i it changes to a1a4g
		Make scaffold brushbased thing to make the player able to climb the pipe and get to the other rooms
			Toss some medits since the pipe's fall takes some damage, can't do shit to prevent it to happen
		Remake layout of the alpha room with houndeyes, used to be like that because that used to be the old den
		Lighting on the sewer den
		That room with the fans needs something meaningful
		Add ladders on each vertical pipe PLEASE
		Make platforming on the final pipe segment not painful for the player, just think about a player with 1 HP AAA
		Connect to a2a1
			Make the connection like i told you zed STOP MAKING IT LIKE RETAIL IT'S BAD AND MAKES ZERO SENSE
				https://i.imgur.com/vhkR3XX.png I even made a draft for you, please

A2A1

- General Polish

	A2A1 - It's kinda there but we need lots of stuff done
		Add train (idk why it isn't there)
		Fix train shit DEAD PLEASE DO IT
		Fix brushwork
		I don't even know if the thing that powers up the train works, look it up
		Position of the vertical hub area is wrong
			Entrance should be on the middle
			Room with grunts and barney should be on the top
			Get rid of the office room with the zombie, keep the valve thing
				This should also be on the middle
			Replace space where the grunt room was with a room similar to the one in retail with bullsquid
	A2A1A - Spiral staircase looks ugly lighting wise, see what you can do about it
		Trigger_push in one of the fans is awfully strong
		Tweak lighting on blue lights so it mixes with the red lights on top and gives that purple tint like on the screenshot
		Tweak lighting on the teal lights so they match with the screenshots
- Original maps:
	- c2a1 — train tunnels. Cool.
	- c2a1a — lots of bad guy troopers.

A2A2

- Develop
- Fix the fucking lift to A2A3, I have it working in an isolated map, but once brought over to A2A2 it breaks again.
- Original maps:
	- c2a2
	- c2a2a
	- c2a2b
	- c2a2c
	- c2a2d

	- c2a2f
	- c2a2g
	- c2a2h
	- c2a2i
	- c2a2j

A2A3

- Develop
- I swear the one ad with the HGrunts is the original end of this chapter. You go from the Abandoned Silo and sector to a non-abandoned region where Grunts reside. You battle them out and get ambushed. 
	- The only things that back up my idea is the general concept of being in an abandonned silo then ending up in a section where you have to fight off grunt and get ambushed and the use of a texture that would of been seen in the abanndoned sections of C2A3 on the other side of the window.
A2A3

Train from a2a2 stops on dead end (broken debris)

At the right the player finds the old entrance of the silo (reusing brushwork from the alpha silo entrance)

Power's out, the player should use the emergency hatch to open a small silo door and turn the power back on

	Lights go on

Player swims down (fights archers or whatever dead wants idc at this point) gets to the old entrance from silodemo

A2A3A

We make the first segment larger, more rooms to explore (remove the tunnel section, that shit's out of the alpha C3A1)
	Somehow connect this segment with a big room with computers that haves the lower half of the turbine on the ceiling
		And connect it to the silodemo storage area (breakable vent or a staircase)
	As for big machine rule, follow the brushwork around (might make an isolated version for better use) //Done-ish
	Valve controlled gate behind the machine room leads straight to next map //Done-ish, needs more brushwork for better detail (light sources, props, etc)

A2A3B

Go crazy, electrified grate door should be somewhere

	Cut version of the cage scene should also be there

A2A3C

	Tweak retail map around screenshots

	Freezer > Isolated tunnel from WC shot

	Tunnel > BabTech Small base with grunts

		Important: follow ded's idea of using the promo shot (a1a3_posterarea.jmf on Captain Zed/A1A3/sECCOM/)

	Grunt base > ambush

- Original maps:
	- c2a3
	- c2a3a — tunnels with water and crabs.
	- c2a3b
	- c2a3c
	- c2a3d

A2A4

- General Polish

It's pretty much done, re-connect the blue labs back and squeeze it in with the lobby entrance

//Done connecting the maps and adding the blue labs now we need:
	Proper scripts on a2a4e
		Make red signs to glow above switches
		Toss more ceiling turrets and make each floor switch to trigger them for better clearance
		Fade when camera transition kicks in (and fade out, duh)
	a2a4f
		DSP effects on blue lab
		Toss enemies (agrunts/islaves on upper part, archers and headcrabs on water section)
		Some line should play when you encounter the sci and barney on the agrunt room
			c2a4's argument scene would fit like a glove there
		See a way to make the agrunts to jump/get out of their cages
			So far they only break the glass
		Flesh out the lobby area more
			Slap security outpost where the desk is
			Add optional rooms at the halls on the sides
			
		Script the lobby area
			Osprey should pass by followed by the hgrunts falling down
			After being done killing them a scientist would come out, talk about the situation, and open the exit door for you

a2a5 - Dam //Done
	a2a5a - Cliff
		fix skybox //Done
		remove rpg room, move it to 2nd desert map
	a2a5b - desert map 1
		first desert map should be an introduction to the apache
			Look for desert shots for brushwork and layouts
	a2a5c - desert map 2
		slap barney into valve room, make him mention the rpg, place rpg inside of a tent
			Look for desert shots for brushwork and layouts

A3A1

- General polish and Medium Reworks
- Still slightly unhappy with this map, mainly the warehouse and level transitions from the sewer
- connect a3a1 to a3a2
	change the way to get into a3a1a
		either make an extra "maintenance" lift where the sewer access is
		or make it like the alpha where the same elevator from datacore haves the sewer on the elevator shaft
			//Personally i'd like to make it like on the alpha - Alan
