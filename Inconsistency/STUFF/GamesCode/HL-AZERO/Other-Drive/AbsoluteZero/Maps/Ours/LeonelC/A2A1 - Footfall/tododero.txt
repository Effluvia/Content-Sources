-Finish tunnels proportions with the ones provided by tart
-FIGURE OUT A FUCKING WAY TO NOT BREAK THE GARG CUTSCENE (maybe add a trigger when making the garg mad to kill every scripted shit)
-Fill a2a1a's generator area with more aliens, feels empty //Added barnacles, still feels empty
-Make the train to work (zed, u do it I have no clue about func_trains) // Already works, it only lacks a transition to a2a2 (still in works)
-Add the zombie room (again) but this time so everything is on grid // Done, blueprint thingy still needs work
-Add some sounds to the garg's cutscenes
-Add some decals to the garg's cutscenes
-Add some env_shakes to the garg's cutscenes
-Same with the power generator (maybe use some silo textures since the chapter uses some of them)
