- Properly connect the tunnel leading from a2a1 and the tunnel from which a2a2 starts. (the E3 1998 gruntfight area)

- Change the order of the retail c2a2 maps, so that they would be ordered similarly to the beta (What we do know is that the gruntfight area together with the rocket launch complex was intended to be at the start of the chapter)

- Get the rocket launch sequence properly working on a2a2 and make it so the scientist opens the doors to the elevator area once the rocket has been launched, so the player can progress into a2a2a.

- IDK what map it could've been in, but there apparently was a second elevator in c2a2 in the beta. In there, the player would most likely have returned to the rocket launch complex at the end of c2a2 to go to c2a3.

- One thing I noticed in retail c2a2b1 is that the rocket silo still has climbable ladders. Was the rocket launch originally intended for the end of c2a2 in the beta?

- Add Human Assaults where the commander (African-American soldier with cigar) soldiers are in retail.

- Get the Floaters working properly codingwise.
