Entrance to silo was mostly different (aka no derrailed train segment)
	It was probably longer
		Im certain valve wanted to give this area a proper introduction at some point but had to rush it
		//IDEA: Slap alpha's entrance to c1a4 silo, lights and services are turned off, have to get into one of the maintenance rooms and power up the place back again
Silo segment was probably shorter (no forced wall like on retail to make the layout larger)
	All the entrances on the silo were for making the player to climb up (or down?) so either the entrance was on the bottom or at the top (same goes for the exit)
		1st floor (bottom of the silo) didn't have
		//Could also be potentionally a remnant of the old silo map
		//https://i.imgur.com/UQawL2c.png
	The rails on the crane were for lifting whoever had to control it, not for a train to ride through
		We need proper Crane textures for the old beta version
	Seems the crane itself had it's lower section expanded //nope me fucking up the levels and dead having the staircases on the wrong levels
	Light lamps on north wall had light_spots unlike the other walls
	
Next map - C2a3a - aka HOLY FUCK RILLER IS ALSO WORKING ON THIS
	From our experiences with On a Rail we can also tell that C2A3 was heavily butchered, or at least altered
		WC Guide on OCT 97 shows parts of c2a3a
			Tunnel thing on the 3d view was isolated, we don't know if it was ever used on the game at some point
				(probably prefab'd from Riller's work to show off the path tool)
			On the WC guide he mentions the use of a "Cordon" feature, it lets you isolate an area of your choice, and when you compile the map only said area will get affected.
				At first I thought that maybe only the tunnel was brought from another map, since it's blueprint lines were white, but the square room with crates is also isolated and it's lines are gray
					so nah, it's probable there is a lot of isolated rooms that Riller used for reference/prefab
		The room with highly detailed corners in front of the flooded storage area is also potentionally an isolated room piece brought from another map
			Can't see any brushwork of it in all 3 views from the 2 shots of worldcraft, so it's probable it's out of bounds or far enough it doesn't get rendered
	It looks like the storage area from silodemo is also being used
		Probably reuse it on the first segment
	Some room rollers/cylinder-like brushes (probably some stairs?)
		//Other end of the turbine
	And then the ickyroom
		Exit from there was downstairs, not upstairs
			There was a room dedicated to the valve controlled gate
		No lab with sci
		No cage
			Probably recycle the cut version (where barney is involved) of the icky scene, and slap it into a2a3b
		Some wierd ass steam/pump machines, brushwork is ez to do

C2a3B
	Nothing to research on, everything screams retail
		Electrified fence bit is too good to be something they put at the last moment
			Yea, rest is really poopy
C2A3C

	Just look at the shots, vent access to next map is forced as fuck
		Obvious stuff, filled with zombies, ceiling was lower, pipes had placeholder textures, there even was more pipes, yadda yadda
	Slap isolated tunnel thing at the end of the freezer
C2A3D
	NOTHING, it uses textures from different chapters, brushwork is way too clean, so it probably was redone from scratch
		player start is kinda wierd, might look into that
		The room where you get caught is interesting tho, it's done with func_walls instead of world brushes
			Mostly leftovers of the old camera script
	
DA END

Plan for AZ

A2A3

Train from a2a2 stops on dead end (broken debris)

At the right the player finds the old entrance of the silo (reusing brushwork from the alpha silo entrance)

Power's out, the player should use the emergency hatch to open a small silo door and turn the power back on

	Lights go on

Player swims down (fights archers or whatever dead wants idc at this point) gets to the old entrance from silodemo

A2A3A

We make the first segment larger, more rooms to explore (remove the tunnel section, that shit's out of the alpha C3A1)
	Somehow connect this segment with a big room with computers that haves the lower half of the turbine on the ceiling
		And connect it to the silodemo storage area (breakable vent or a staircase)
	As for big machine rule, follow the brushwork around (might make an isolated version for better use) //Done-ish
	Valve controlled gate behind the machine room leads straight to next map //Done-ish, needs more brushwork for better detail (light sources, props, etc)

A2A3B

Go crazy, electrified grate door should be somewhere

	Cut version of the cage scene should also be there

A2A3C

	Tweak retail map around screenshots

	Freezer > Isolated tunnel from WC shot

	Tunnel > BabTech Small base with grunts

		Important: follow ded's idea of using the promo shot (a1a3_posterarea.jmf on Captain Zed/A1A3/sECCOM/)

	Grunt base > ambush
