c2a5 - Cliff Hanger
- You will need to decompile the retail maps for somethings.
	- the VMFs for HLS were around the time they started introducing displacements into the maps.
- Once a map is cleaned up, slap her into rework.
	- it is where I'm putting the revised chapters into onto my personal drive.
	- Granted, if I get it back, it'll likely end up in the "Final" dir if finished or if unfinished, into a folder labeled Xylemon without a rework lablel. (so, Maps/Xylemon/a2a5/blah.jmf)
	- It will just keep it well organized.
- Documents for maps will be in the rework folder and not with their actual JMFs.
	- Organizing!
- Ignore the boot camp photos (besides bootcamp_boring.jpg)
	- These were from Surface Tension from Nov 97, seems in Dec 97 (0.61) it became what we know (some what) today.
	- also ignore "235.jpg," this too is from Nov 97
	- It appears the only real difference from this version of the chapter compared to Dec 97 is c2a5.bsp itself, but we also have some interior maps that don't align with anything that we assume were also pre-Dec 97 c2a5.
	- Basically, too little info to go off of. We'd be here all day trying to come up with something, and that's just time we don't have.

Maps:
a2a5 - base upon VMF
	- Don't think there's much you can salvage from ours, I think we did remake the brushes from a decompile due to them being replaced in the VMF with displacements, unsure of how well our recreations were tho.
a2a5a - base upon VMF
	- our JMF doesnt seem too fucked, but I know at some point Zed and Alan started being funny with Surface Tension maps and were doing weird vile things. Better Safe than sorry.
	- The entity work should be good though.
a2a5b - "c2a5/a2a5b.jmf"
	- This was made in a sweet spot where Jackhammer supported VMF conversion natively and we weren't stupid.
	- Zed barely modded it, so corruption should be minimum, if any is present.
a2a5c - base upon VMF
	- Ours was complete HELL. Nothing was salvagable, I think I even deleted what Zed had done with the map because of how bad it was!
a2a5d - "c2a5/rework/c2a5d.jmf"
	- Map will obviously need to be renamed to a2a5d
	- I hid the entities to make it easier to work on, but I didn't actually resetup the entities to match either the beta or even retail HL. So map will be broken.
	- Be warned, this map crashes HLAZ, even the stock HL version. Those Gauss beam sparks cause the game to go sicko mode. Unless blue has since optimized this, haven't tested since.
a2a5e - "c2a5/rework/c2a5e.jmf"
	- Besides the last note, its the same situation as a2a5d.
	- Valve didn't resort to using slopes in maps until very late into development.
a2a5f - base upon VMF
	- Hell.
	- No seriously, this map is fucked. This is one of the worst maps in retail Surface Tension.
	- I am unsure how this would of originally went, you might be able to figure something out with referencing the even ground. The areas that would of been the original ground level before slopes.
	- "spiderdecal.jpg" was either this map or a2a5e.
a2a5g - "c2a5/landingfieldbecausecasali.jmf"
	- no I do not know why Alan named this that instead of a2a5g or whatever, don't even bother asking.
		- yes it took me awhile to figure out this was the map I was looking for, the outdated version was named something more logical.
	- Unsure on how this map entirely went. No idea if there were two garages, two stories to one garage, or whatever.
	- The side cliffs need to be reverted back to the retail mountain textures.
		- ESCalation did an edit to this map for one of his videos, and I recall his cliff on the side looking better than how it actually looked in the original map.
		- Why Valve only chose to make like a dozen cliffs on one wall that went halfway through. Obviously, probably optimization, but it looks fucking stupid and ugly.
	- I did attempt to make this connect seamlessly with a3a1, but we could never get the ceiling caving in event to work, and obviously, we gave up on this map long ago.
