Okay, so, it's late at night, I have my ideas in my head, let me try to fucking transfer it over.

What I've noticed about On A Rail (in some form, don't know if it's the beta ver, retail ver, or all ver) is that each map is focused around a gimmick or a puzzle.

The most noticable one for me is the E3 demo map, it's entirely focused around the 2 rooms with moving crates. But it is NOT isolated to that.

A2A2G's gimmick is that you go up an lift while grunts are combating you on a lift.
A2A2D's gimmick is that you have to open the doors to the rocket room and transfer to a new train.
A2A2E's gimmick likely involved the player going to A2A2F to make the connection to A2A2E to A2A2G work
A2A2C's gimmick is train swapping (again)
A2A2H's gimmick is about HGrunts and Floaters battling it out and having an alt path to take by foot.

So, what does that mean? Each map revolves around the player having to do something. We know the track changing section from C2A2E existed in some form in the beta, meaning it likely had a puzzle involved.

We know that elevators had a role in the chapter originally (you enter the the rail system via an elevator, and leave it via elevator too)

My guess A2A2E involved the player having to backtrack back into the other rails to get to an elevator they found, which takes them back to another previous map that had a non-functioning elevator (at least, button wise)

From there, they'll have to back track again to get to another elevator, one of which takes you back to A2A2 to launch the rocket.

This is why a few of the maps have constant loops, I would assume. So the player can hop back onto a train after they completed a certain area and get to a previous area.
