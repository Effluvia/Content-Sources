- This is Threeway.
- There were actually only 2 paths you could take in this map.
	- One to a1a1e and one to a1a1b
- I don't quite know what aesthetic we want to go with
	- I want something more consistent than "some is E3 and some is Nov 97"
	- I guess base it more upon the Nov 97 screens in Dank and Scud, I dont like the tiny bridges tho.
- Those cut outs in the ground you could see through
	- Likely possible that the player was able to get to those sections via A1A1B from the sewer sections.
	- No idea what purpose it would serve.
- The rotation of the map is wrong, match it up with a1a1e.
- In this map there's supposed to be a lift, what it does or where it was is unknown.
	- likely is the thing we thought was a lift, but I don't know what purpose it would serve.
