- Plays out mainly like the E3 demo.
- There's a section you get to via the vent seen in a1a2c.
	- This just mimicks the supply section seen in retail.
- Right now the room by the turret from a1a2a is strictly in the previous map and acts like the alpha one.
	- This seemly isn't how the beta one went.
	- Apparently, the door behind Barney in the Offices demo leads down to that room.
- For further context, its the room with the window by the turret after the box puzzle.
	- The room in the alpha just connected up with a door by the room, but in the beta, there's a stair case that takes it up to the door by Barney seen in the E3 demo.
- I forgot to make the filing cabinets consistent with the ones seen in later maps.
	- I had fixed them up in the later maps, but never went back to a1a2b to fix them.
	- Not sure if the ones in a1a2d are corrected either.
