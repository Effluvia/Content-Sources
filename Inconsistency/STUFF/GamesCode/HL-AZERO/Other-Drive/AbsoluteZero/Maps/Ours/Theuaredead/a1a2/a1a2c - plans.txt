- Boxart Cafeteria could of been two areas, either in the hall I currently have it in, or down where you fall from the glass.
	- If the former, you fall down the glass and go into the box art cafeteria.
	- If the latter, you fall down into the box art area, then walk to get to the hallway above.
- At the bottom of the staircase, you meet a dying Scientist and a Barney by his side.
	- This is the dying friend sequence that you can find in retail. Except its a Barney and Scientist instead of two Barneys
	- Its the same sequence we currently have in HLAZ, except we're not using the Blast Pit animation.
- At the beginning of the retail map there's a vent to access a room that contains supplies.
	- This still exists in the beta, but the room is in A1A2B and was likely designed differently.
- The Barncle room's textures are a nightmare. They've always been poorly done, even since the alpha.
	- If possible, try to clean up the vents in that room.
- There's some areas that are a mystery to us on how they went in the beta.
	- These areas exist in the alpha, but we're unsure on how they went in the beta.
	- I will provide my alpha decompiles, so you can play around with how to enhance those areas for the beta design.
- The part where you walk over the main cafeteria (not boxart) has a dumb puzzle in the alpha.
	- If possible, try to make it a in-between of the alpha and what we did in HLAZ stock.
- I tried adding back in the restrooms, but there's no way for the mirror to be able to function in there.
	- If anything, you could possibly readd in that gag from the old HLAZ maps where the restroom was flooded out.
