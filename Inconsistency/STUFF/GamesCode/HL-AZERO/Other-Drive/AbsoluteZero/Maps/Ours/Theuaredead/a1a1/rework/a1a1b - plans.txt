- This is mainbridge.
	- This area used to be the alien prison in the alpha.
- The sewers were more flushed out originally.
	- Likely playing similarly to how it did in the alpha to some extent.
- Walking across the bridge will lead you to threeway.
	- You wouldn't be able to do anything there as you need to go to box puzzle.
	- There's likely an in-between room from main to three, similar to the area that connects Akira to Main.
- Like in retail, you jump down to that door and end up in the box puzzle.
