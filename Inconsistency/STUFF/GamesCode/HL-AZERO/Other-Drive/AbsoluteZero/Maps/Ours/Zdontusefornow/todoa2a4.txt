residue processing

-readd intro sequence (player coming out of the pipe thanks to trigger_push and func_friction)
-add floating scientist corpses at the pool where the player spawns
	*Readd animations into the mdl (Day One model haves them)
-restore cut cactus (it's in some of the c2a5 maps)
-Revert most of the texture changes made by zed (Dead knows which ones should be fixed and which ones not)
-Find a way to make the attached yellow lamps prettier (lighting leaks from above) //Light_surface should do the trick, will investigate further
-Texture the conveyor supports with proper textures (GIRD textures)
-Tweak lighting on most of the maps
-Lift room should be tighter/smaller to avoid the player from falling and getting softlocked

alien research lab

-toss enemies around
-make crates breakable and give loot
-finish the puzzle on a2a4e
	*The two rooms where the scientist are should have switches, these will have multisources to make the player able to open the door to the final map
-add sounds
-add env_sounds (DSP effects)
-tweak rads for better lighting
	*Greens are too strong
	*Blue, Red and Yellow on a2a4d are too strong and dim
-connect a2a4d with lobby map (leonelc's folder)
-connect lobby map with a2a4g
-connect a2a4g with a2a5 (I think that's been already done but idr)

lobby area:

-Either a bunch of grunts or a bunch of aliens //Maybe a bunch of aliens so the repel grunts have a heavier impact
-Add a room on each hall, one should be accesible with goodies, the other unreachable (potential gman appearance)
-You'd hear a scientist and barney argue (they aren't aware of your presence), from a security outpost where the desk is (make desk larger or extend it
-Go through the metal detector to set it off, entire lobby enters into emergency mode, red lights everywhere, siren kicks in, grunts repel from ceiling
-Once you kill everyone, siren goes off, barney and scientist come out of the outpost running
	*Barney comments about the mess you did
	*scientist recognizes you and tells you everything about the surface and how to get to lambda complex
	*Opens the rotating door for you
