//Add any custom "Texture light" Values into the end of this file
//Example - 
//custcompscn		255 255 255 1000
//This would make the texture "custcompscn" have a yellow light, and emit 1000 brightness
//Texture light bright values also tend to be less powerful then there point light sisters, so keep this in mind
//when you are compiling your map
