Hi,
 
There are many maps that we (I) didn't include the final game. Over the course of the project I'd prototyped a great deal of play and explored different concepts for the world. That shot was a transition area from a canal/sewer area to an industrial area where containers were moved along a ceiling mounted conveyor type system. The player navigated across chasms by riding atop the containers. 
 
Fun fact: the player also used containers to crush things below; something that was later used in HL2.
 
I have all of my maps and some screenshots screenshots can be found here and there online.
