- connect a1a4 to a2a1
	big pipe with flowing water pushes you to grate on a2a2, climb sewer access to storage/maintenance room that connects to hub area with garg
- Add a way to kill the garg on a2a1
	big idea: make it so you have to crash the train into a generator and zap the garg to death
	smol idea: make it like retail
- connect a2a1 to a2a2
	fix rotating platform and brushwork on a2a11
- create a2a3
- connect a2a2 to a2a3
	kinda easy to pull since the end of a2a2 is the first map (that's already done)
- add ambush on a2a3 and connect to a2a4

		connect to a3a1
- connect a3a1 to a3a2
	change the way to get into a3a1a
	either make an extra "maintenance" lift where the sewer access is
	or make it like the alpha where the same elevator from datacore haves the sewer on the elevator shaft
		//Personally i'd like to make it like on the alpha - Alan

Fixes - note
----

platform where the player stands on the zombie fight room (a1a2) should be 1 tile shorter
	also make the hall leading to it shorter

connection from a1a3 and a1a3a should not be like it is currently
	change enemy position of a1a3a
		make them to be on the left from where the player comes out, will make the battle easier and will incentivate the player to push forward
	a1a3c - remake the mortar table from c2a5 and put it on the "campus" outside of the storage area, once you kill the grunt operating it, the mortars will stop shooting
	a1a3 - make security outpost's door to open (ez to do)
