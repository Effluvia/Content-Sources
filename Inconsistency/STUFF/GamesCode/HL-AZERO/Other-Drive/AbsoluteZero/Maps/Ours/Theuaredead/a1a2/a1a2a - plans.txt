- Power box in the room (357_beta) will turn off the eletric water in the flooded room (195)
	- The water will be an instant kill if you fall in
	- Before you go into the room, the scientist will fall into the water and get shocked to death.
	- once you turn off the power to the room via that box, make sure the Scientist is already dead in the water.
- Instead of escorting the Scientist to Zombie Fight, he'll run over there after he tries opening the door.
	- Is there a wave animation he could play? no idea, should we do that or should we just have him run up to the door and try to open it like it does already?
	- Possibly have him cancel out his sequence of him trying to open the door and have him stop trying to open the door when the player breaks the glass and run to the zombie fight area.
- The audio in Zombie Fight needs fixed, right now it emits from the models and its super quiet.
- There's supposed to be a scientist in the glass room, When you break the vent he will wave at you.
	- Likely gave a speach about how the grunts are here to kill.
