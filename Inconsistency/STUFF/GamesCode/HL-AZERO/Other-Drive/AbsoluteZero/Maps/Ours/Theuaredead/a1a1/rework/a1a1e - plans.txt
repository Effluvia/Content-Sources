- This is where the alpha cuts out and is the map that connects up to the mystery a1a2 map.
	- Literally have no idea what to do with this or that map.
- Starting to have my doubt that the one section connected with this map, the one with the generators.
	- Could be Blast Pit or Power Up, but after doing research, it's bordering on impossible to connect to those anyway.
- What I do know however, is that you don't directly ended up in offices in this map.
	- The changelevel would be the connection to offices.
