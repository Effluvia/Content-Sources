-Make the train to start running after a countdown is done, and make it unusable by the player

-Scripted sequence on the first map (barney getting wrecked, barney watching everything and trying to stop you, barney/construction climbing some boxes)

-We need a new intro to a1a4b (reskinned retail doesn't cut it) the brushwork of the lift and it's shaft could help how it was planned (see also how a1a4 looks and work, it's obvious the train's path rounds the silo, our entrance goes the other way)

-Better brushwork for a1a4d's sewer access (PLEASE) // we can use worldcraft 1.1's pipes

// Done // Make the rocket test to actually work, killing the tentacles and disabling the func_wall_toggle (in case you want to work on it just remove the master pointer on the button)

-Fix the rocket motor model prop lighting

-OXY/FUEL puzzle is still incomplete, needs to be fully implemented (think of the concept art puzzle, make some func_pushables be detected with trigger_onces that only check for pushables, pointing a multisource)

-Generator room isn't even started, we should make it like the concept art (valve sorta did it, but in a different way, the "machinery" are the spinning platforms, and the 3 switchs generator are just two switches)
