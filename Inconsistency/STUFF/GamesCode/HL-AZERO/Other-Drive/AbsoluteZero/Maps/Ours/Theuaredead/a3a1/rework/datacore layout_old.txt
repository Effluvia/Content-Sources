- Left side (01-r) led to the data control operations room (half_2_4) and the wallway that splits off by the ladder leads to the satalite access room (halflife4.)
- Start of the map is from where we have the access elevator. (131) How this area went is a bit unknown, we assume that the alpha hallway is still here. (dance_troupe)
- Right side of the map is currently unknown. Basic geometry is still intact, but we know that the obervation area (15-r) was attached to that side.
- The reception area had the access elevator to take you back to the beginning of the chapter (hlbs2)
- Maintence hallway still lead into both hallways. However, the maintence cooridor was mirror in the deathmatch map, is only supposed to lead into the right side of the map.
- Floor was also lowered in the cooridor.
- In the deathmatch map of datacore the hallway that is supposed to lead into the satalite access elevator room is connected to the right side of the map. This was not the case in the beta due to the poor geometry connected the halves.
	- We can confirm this as the floor brush that states the original stair location still exists in the map.
- Bevel in the wall on the right side was a detail added in for Deathmatch, we came this conclusion due to the misaligned floor around it.
	- This statement is not entirely true. The floor was definately not original, but 2 nodes and 2 env_sounds point to this leading into something that would have a "Chamber Large" env_sound.
	- Looking at the alpha, we can draw that there two doors to the obervation area, there are two nodes at some what the same area.
	- This bevel would likely originally been the entrance to the obervation area.
- Right room's only purpose seems to be to again access to the obervation area, the reception room, and the maintence hallway. Which is the same as the left, excluding the left's connection to the starting point.
