(640 is just a flag so the code grabs it for 640x480 res and higher)
(Lave code alias intact unless you are a coder)

^This is an example don't follow it perfectly

XOrig and YOrig are the reference points where the "cropping" (chopping, cutting, you name it) will begin

The reference on these start from the 0 pixel (aka first pixel) starting FROM THE LEFT OF YOUR CANVAS
	Let's say your sprite is a 64x64 black sprite with a 32x32 gray square on the middle, XOrig and YOrig would be 16 in both field, since the "starting point" will be from the up-most right corner of your black square
		The cropping will take the pixels ON the range that you specified, so no need to leave your cropping with leftover pixels
			The origin of these two coordinates will also determine the alignment of your sprite in-game, so again, make it precise
Width and Height will determine the size of the cropping (again, by using XOrig and YOrig as a starting point)
	Back with the square, Width and Height would be 32 in both fields

But you might be asking, how the fuck do i do all of this?

Quite easy

Make a new layer on top of your sprite

Grab the eyedropper tool.

Make sure you have the "Info" window enabled (shows your brush info) and click on the "info" tab within
	In case you don't have such window, press f8
Hold shift and click where you want XOrig YOrig to be pointing and, and get the X and Y coordinates from your cursor's position above the pointer by looking at the values on the middle left section of the info window
	And type them down on your hud.txt
	//You can also do all of this by creating a new layer and painting a pixel with a bright color using the pen tool

Now, into the width.

This one is quite fast to do, grab the rectangle selection tool, and by starting on top (not at the sides) of your marker's pixel, draw an square of the area you want to crop down. 
	Now, instead of grabbing the info from the same place we did previously, you should grab the XY values from the numbers NEXT to them, these one show the range of pixels on your selection
	//You can also do all of this by grabbing the square selection down and get the values that change on top of the marching ants while holding down your primary button
As usual, type them down.
