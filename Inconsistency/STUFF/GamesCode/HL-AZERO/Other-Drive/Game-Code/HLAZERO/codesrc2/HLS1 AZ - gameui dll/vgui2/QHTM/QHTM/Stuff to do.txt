Extras
------

* HTML Button
Button control that allows HTML to be used instead of plain text. Ideally it would be a single function call to change a normal button to be a QHTM button.
Could register a 'class' that would allow buttons on dialogs to be set as HTMl from the getgo ("QHTM_Button").

* HTML Listbox
Allow HTML to be used in lists boxes. This would mean icons could be use as well as formatting and colours (fore and background colours).

* Open up the renderer so HTML can be 'drawn' onto any device.

* Create Tip of the Day object as an example.

* Log file output with colourd highlights example.



CSS Stuff to support and my notes
---------------------------------
hehe, nothing yet, still reading...


HTML that causes problems
-------------------------

* This just doesn't look right, look at the difference between IE and QHTM.
Try changing align=left and we get similar stupid differences between QHTM and IE.
