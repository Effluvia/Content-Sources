<h3>What can Zoom+ do?</h3>
<img src="selected.bmp" alt="Selected with context menu" border="0" width="297" height="258" align="right">
<br>Zoom+ is a general screen magnification tool. It can magnify any portion of the screen by up to 32 times. Panning around, zooming in or out.

<h4>Icon Thief</h4>
Zoom+ provides software developers and web designers with an easy method of grabbing
screen elements such as toolbar buttons and icons from running programs or web sites.
Simply zoom in on the area you are interested in and copy the view to the clipboard, or for
more precision, click the right mouse button on the Zoom+ window and drag a selection
rectangle. When you release the right mouse button you can copy a selection of the screen
to the clipboard or save it to file.

<h4>Pixel Counting</h4>
Zoom+ also adds easy pixel counting by giving a selection marquee when the right
mouse button is dragged on the main window. This selection can then be copied to clipboard
or saved to file. Whilst the selection marquee is displayed a tool tip of the selection
dimensions is displayed.

<h4>Context Menus</h4>
Context menus provide context sensitive choices. The status bar colour and
co-ordinates panels have their own context menu and the main display has one for just right
clicking on the display and one for when you right-drag on the main display.

<h4>Status Bar</h4>
The status bar displays really useful information such as the colour beneath the
pointer, in both a colour panel and as RGB. There is also a panel that displays the
current mouse co-ordinates in either screen co-ordinates or co-ordinates relative to the
client area of the window beneath the cursor. The colour format and the co-ordinate choice
can be changed from the options dialog or from the context menu on the colour panel.<br>

</td><td valign="top"><font size=2>
<h4>Grid</h4>
An overlay grid allows for quick sizing and alignment of screen elements, the
grid size and colour can be changed from the options dialog available from the main
context menu or from the system menu. You can toggle the grid on and off by using the tool
bar button or a shortcut key.

<h4>Other</h4>
To maximise your screen usage you can switch off the toolbar and status from the
main context menu. All toolbar features are available from either the main context menu or
from keyboard shortcuts.<br>
Intellimouse support means you can zoom in and out using CTRL+Mouse Wheel, plus internet
style panning is supported simply by clicking the middle mouse button

<h4>Context Help</h4>
Zoom+has full help throughout, try right clicking on the tool bar or status bar and selecting
What's This from the context menu. There is full context help in the options dialog too.

<h4><a name="source">Source Code</a></h4>
<p>Zoom+ grew up very quickly, help was added, configuration dialog and context menus came. I also added the nag screen and the shareware stuff. I was never really happy with this and I have now removed the nagware.</p>
<p>Not only that but I feel the source code also serves as a good example so I have decided to release it. I consider the source code to be open, that is you can amend it and use it but the copyright remains mine. It's as simple as that.</p>
<p><b>Changes?</b> You will find a file called "Features not done.txt" which describes some of the features I have yet to implement. Maybe you would like to add them instead or perhaps there is a feature you want yourself. If you add or fix anything be sure to <a href="mailto:russf@gipsysoft.com">email</a> me the source changes and I will merge them into the main source.</p>
