fuck everything, c2a5b was the military camp, it just got heavily edited during the reboot, layout should be just like retail, dam, desert, milicamp, shelled buildings (we replace it with boot camp), rocket warehouse, osprey landing field, garg and mortar puzzle, and then to a3a1

***parking lot idea***

By looking at the final brushwork of the parking bit, it all points the original version was also underground, seems the entrance was guarded by two medium-sized rooms (guarding areas?, you can see at least one of them got shelled on the brightness test on WON builds, and the texture set it used), you are supposed to find the entrance being defended by a couple of hgrunts getting roasted by a gargantua.
The mortar radar should be inside the non-destroyed tower, locked by a keycard, the keycard is deep within the parking building. The place itself will be splitted into two floors.
The first one should be filled with hgrunts/hassaults, at the entrance of the last floor, a couple of barneys/scientist should be guarding the area, blocking the path with cars, the scientist should spit his unused line, and then proceed to the last level.
The last level should show signs of xen biological residue lurking around (like op4 did on later stages) agrunts/islaves/kingpins should be scattered the area, and you will find the corpse of a hgrunt inside a storage room, with the keycard next to him.
After you grab the keycard, you will have to go all the way up to the locked tower, that keeps the mortar radio on top of it, with it you will have to bomb the entrance to a3a1 and kill the gargantua (or not).

08:10 p.m. - That's that: so
08:10 p.m. - That's that: I remove the rocket building i forced there
08:11 p.m. - That's that: and replace it with a bigger hangar
08:11 p.m. - That's that: you should get there by doing the vent crawling volvo planned on the cabals
08:12 p.m. - That's that: you see the first kingpin battling with grunts and yadda yadda
08:13 p.m. - That's that: and on the other side of the hangar there is an emergency exit from the actual military camp, or some sort of command center, idk, it should be a smaller version of boot_camp, without most of the MP bullshit
08:13 p.m. - That's that: AND on the middle, you should see that building with the rockets we were talking about
08:14 p.m. - That's that: you approach it like on retail, but you make use of the buildings near it to get on the roof of the place
08:15 p.m. - That's that: from there to osprey land, and then helipad with the parking lots, you climb up to the roof of the parking lot, find the radar, blow the entrance to a3a1, and done

*By looking deeper into the military camp's cabal (and the one with the grunts with the cliff cabal), the base haves only HALF of the base with walls, (where the player wanders around to get in), the other side is just one of the sides of the cliff, barricated with sandbags to prevent disasters (it'd also explain why the chemical toilets are there)

*Desert bit is going to be only one map covering the walled side of the camp, valve sliced it because... who knows? (probs would be bc compiling times were 2long due to all the complex brush work) The only way to limit the player is by just getting to one of the ends of the cliff (if the player goes too much to the left when facing the military camp) and with a bunch of rocks (if the player wanders too much to the right when facing the military camp).

layout ideas for c2a5

c2a5, just like retail, but instead of leading to the desert part with the chopper it takes you to:

c2a5a, cliffhanger, it doesn't  make sense how on the mag pictures you can kill an apache without having an rpg (you still have the gaussgun but i'm pretty sure they never tought of having a casual player to know that), so maybe this was intended to be the very first encounter, and letting the player know you need some big weapons to take down apaches, we should add a huge room for the rpg room since it doesn't make sense how it haves this huge door but it leads to nothing besides that metal door (was it there on the earlier stages?), plus adding a barn talking about the rpg guarded by guards.

c2a5b, which is c2a5b on retail, since you enter from the shutter, you can actually see the grunt jumping the sandbags and the other soldier locking you down, this one should lead to:

c2a5c, the desert bit with the grunts and the mine field, by how the displacement, placing, and looks of the brush the mine part was mostly retail, altough the headcrab spawns are mostly alpha/beta. Also by the looks of the mag shots they hided something bigger on the final product http://puu.sh/opzJW/748fc12b7b.jpg, it's the military camp, to get there you have to go all around the base's walls until you see a sewer access that the only way to open is by turning a valve on a mini-military outpost (like on retail), both sides of the bootcamp are going to have electrified fences and mining fields, the most "natural" areas of the map are going to be mostly filled with quicksands, hurting cactus, and a guarding apàche.

c2a5d, which is going to be military camp, most of it's geometry is going to contain the stye of c2a5b, with tents 
all over it, and at the bottom of it from there you can see, two huge doors, one being the main entrance that takes 
you to "inferno" (desert map, it's called by that because of all the things you have to get through), the other one 
to the landing field, but can't be open by any means, the area around this door is going to have buildings like the 
ones on the bootcamp screenshots, and it's going to be a less desert area, with grass and concrete, one of those
buildings is going to be the rocket room, that also can't be entered by any "normal means", you will have to explore
the buildings near it so you get to a control room where you can activate the emergency ladder to the rocket room.

c2a5e, rocket room, to get here you will have to make your way a vent access near the roof of the building of c2a5d, it's going to be like retail, except it lacks the rockets and it will be full of explosive barrels, the only way to get to the elevator is through vents and taking advantage of said barrels to make your way into the elevator that leads to

c2a5f, just like c2a5d(end) and c2a5e(start) on retail, but making it so it maches the screenshots, from there the player gets out from a bunker-like structure to face the osprey landing field, full of barrels so the player protects himself of grunt's attacks, after getting down the osprey, the main doors are teared apart by a pack of alien grunts, fighting your way through you get to

c2a5g, parking lot, since there is a landing field nearby, a parking lot would make sense, this one is going to be full of alien foes to fight against, until you reach the end of the parking lot, with a security outpost with a security guard and a scientist, the doctor says his cut line regarding that you are near lambda complex, but you have to make it through the landing field with the gargantua

c2a5h, landing field, as soon as you enter you will see the garg fighting a pack of grunts (playing the unused executing anims) since you still have your rpg down, you can either kill the garg with the RPG or go to the radio tower and kill it from the mortar radar. Radio tower will be just like crossfire's nuke room but modified so it looks like the HECU took the place, once you kill the garg by either means, you will have to blow up the bunker door
by using the mortar radar on it, from there you get a to a tunnel that leads to c3a1.
