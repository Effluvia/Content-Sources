[h1]What is this Mod about?[/h1]

Half-Life: Absolute Zero is a mod dedicated to recreating the version of Half-Life that we never got to experience fully. Our goal to recreate the art-style and chapters featured in Half-Life builds from early to mid 1998. It will feature all the chapters, monsters, and weapons that never made it into the final game.

[h1]Key Features[/h1]
[*] Expanded Multiplayer
[*] Cut/Alter Chapters (Such as Communications Center, the Military Camp in Surface Tension, and more.)
[*] Cut Enemies (Such as the Human Assault, Panthereye, Stukabat, etc..)

[h1]Why Greenlight?[/h1]

We've ran into a hicup with the current state of GoldSource (the engine Half-Life uses) where a good chunk of our features simply cause masive bugs or cause the engine to the hang. So simply, we're going to Greenlight so we can keep our full vision in-tact by providing an earlier depot of the GoldSource engine, in which everything still functions.

But due to this inconvincence, the player gains something from it, originally we had no plans for Multiplayer for Absolute Zero, but now with Greenlight, we see a chance to give the player more to do by giving them a Multiplayer experience.
