Scientist 1 (low): All right, Gordon - your suit should keep you comfortable through all this.
 	The specimen is being readied even as we speak.
	We will warm up the -(if someone can figure out what this says, paste it here)- antimass spectrometer now, and see if we can hold her steady at 80% until the carrier arrives.

Scientist 2 (med): Power in three... two... one...

	FIRST STAGE HUM

Scientist 1 (low): Predictable arrays. Very good. Gordon -

Scientist 3 (high): Mister Freeman, you might want to stand back from the focal beam during this next phase, suit or no suit.

Scientist 2 (med): You weren't planning on having children, were you, Gordon?

Scientist 3 (high): Nonsense! Nothing's been proven!

Scientist 2 (med): Secondary emitters, activating now. (observe retail line)

	2nd phase of motion + sound

Scientist 1 (low): It looks like the crystal sample is ready, Gordon look to the delivery system for your specimen.

	Rises from floor

Scientist 1 (low): Standard insertion, of a not so standard specimen.

	Approach sample

Scientist 3 (high): Wait!

Scientist 2 (med): Capacitors to one oh five percent. Initiating black box messaging.

Scientist 3 (high): What? 

Scientist 1 (low): Gordon, we're bringing the analyzer to superoptimal performace. There's no telling how long the system can take it - or how long the reading will take. Please work efficiently.
