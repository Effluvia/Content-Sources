Ideas for keeping the moddb page alive while developing the full build

*Pre-release model pack

(BarneyX on Ted anims, Buffed scis from render on beta anims, orange hev arms + late beta shotgun)

*Censored models pack

(all the meshes we are recreating, plus the semi-bare mp5)

*Late alpha model pack

(Glock remake, all the v_models with bare hands red hev suit, blue trousers scientists, alpha barney mesh rigged into ted's skeleton)

*Early beta glock

(Silver glock)

*Alpha model pack

(Recreate the bare arms so they can be rigged on all v_s) (maybe rip them from the alpha mp5 or something?) Alpha scientist and barney with all the necessary animations, otherwise unmodified from the alpha. Other NPCs (HGrunt, HAssault, Headcrab, Bullsquid) should also use their alpha models. Also, change the headcrab on the zombie into the alpha one.

NOTE: All this addons should be updated after we release the full build, their first version is going to have Day One v_s only, then after the release, all the v_s.

These addons should be released after we have released DayOne, as the first version will have only the default models, but we will begin releasing the modelpacks after the DayOne release.
