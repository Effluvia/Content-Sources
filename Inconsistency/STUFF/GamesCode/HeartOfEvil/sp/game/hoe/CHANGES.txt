======================================================================

Version 3
- The Colt alternate fire is pistol whip as in the original game.
  Hold the right mouse button down for 2 seconds before swinging
  to do 3x damage. Mostly useful for killing crabs.
- Humans create footstep splashes in shallow water.
- The special-ops snipers have a "laser sight" to indicate where they are
  aiming.  Just think of it as a gameplay mechanic rather that a real laser.
- Helicopters do a tailspin for a few seconds before exploding into chunks.
- Barney/soldiers can shoot and reload while running, and can run/walk while
  facing in any direction.
- Sarge flies off with his chopper after the episode B ambush instead of
  going back into the house.
- The two officers who tell you about Kurtz remove their smoking devices
  while speaking.
- The homing chumtoad leads you through the maze much quicker and then dies.
- Added chumtoad ragdolls.
- The 3-headed monkey scene plays out better; no more running back to the
  invisible trigger to make the scene progress.
- Created a TrueType font for the HUD.
- Draw actual weapon models in the weapon selection menu.
- The large monitor in the episode F Half-Life 2 map displays a hint of things
  to come later in the game.
- The flying critters have wings and move around more making them harder to
  shoot.
- The superzombie scene at the airfield in episode D plays out differently.
  Bring the soldier from the prison with you for a surprise.
- Humans and superzombies continue shooting corpses for a few seconds after
  killing an NPC. The length of time can be controlled with the
  hoe_shoot_dead_enemy_time console variable.
- Tried to keep the 3 charlie "snipers" in Alamo in their rooms instead of
  them running out of the building as soon as you show up.
- Tried to keep the 2 charlies in their bunkers at the beginning of Alamo.
- Reduced the delay between shots for NPCs using the rocket launcher.
- Fixed the broken M60 viewmodel.  It had geometry cut out due to having too
  many textures for the Source Engine.
- The Colt viewmodel position was moved left and up.
- Added missing muzzleflash to sniper rifle viewmodel when not zoomed.
- Tweaked the scene where Barney is kidnapped in episode F by adding a rope
  around his leg, making sure his muzzleflash plays, adding a dust trail,
  and pulling him in a straight line.
- Humans respond better to incoming M79 grenades (i.e. they run away if
  the grenade isn't fired from too close range).
- NPCs rapelling from a helicopter appear to come from inside the chopper
  rather than magically appearing below it.
- Randomized the spawn positions of the snipers in episode F.
- Cut away the skyboxes in the last playable map.  As a result the helicopters
  will shoot at you more, helicopter chunks won't land on invisible
  surfaces in the sky, and your RPG rockets won't magically disappear where
  they used to hit the skybox.  It's also possible to make some insane long
  shots with the RPG against the helicopters.
- Enabled helicopter rocket firing on the last playable map.
- Helicopters can shoot rockets at a downward slope of several degrees.
  Originally they could only shoot straight ahead.
- Ragdoll corpses spawn blood when shot.
- Made sure eating creatures face the corpse they are snacking on.
- Fixed some of the "Them" blue-skinned aliens not having their skin, which
  was a second model bodygroup.
- All Hammer-placed corpses - including those hanging from ropes - are ragdolls.
- The few "headless" corpses that were jammed into walls to hide the head
  are now truly headless.
- Lanterns are physics objects and can be destroyed to shut off the light.
- Peasants hanging by their wrists become ragdolls attached to ropes when
  killed rather than dropping to the ground.
- Added ironsights. cvar hoe_ironsights enables/disables ironsights.
  cvar hoe_ironsights_auto controls whether ironsights come on automatically.
- Added a HOE-specific options dialog.
- Added closed captions.
- Added up/down head tilting for friendly NPCs. Previously they only turned
  left/right.
- The squad HUD element displays a health bar next to each member's icon.
- If the crosshair is pointing at a commandable squad member his icon turns
  green in the squad HUD element.
- The sniper rifle has an ironsight zoomable scope. Use mousewheel to zoom
  in/out (or whatever keys are assigned to prev/next inventory item).

======================================================================

Version 4
- Fixed the wrong hat being dropped by npc_mikeforce.
- Fixed superzombie/barneyzombie attacks being interrupted by light damage.
- The M79 ammo pickup always gives 2 grenades regardless of the difficulty
  setting.  Previously on 'hard' only 1 grenade was given; that made starting
  with the M79 on Alamo a bit harder.
- Added spent shell casing ejection to the 870 shotgun viewmodel.
- Show the proper shell type (buckshot or elephantshot) during the 870 shotgun
  reload animation.
- Zombies and Superzombies receive 1/20th of their maximum health each time they
  feed, rather than only 20 points.
- Zombies will sometimes play a "big flinch" animation while chasing an enemy
  when they take heavy damage (from a colt, shotgun or explosion for example).
  The zombie stops and shakes its head when this happens.
- Added hit and miss sounds for the bullsquid tail-spin attack.
- Stopped the bullsquid spitting at the player right after throwing him/her
  since the player is flying through the air at that point.
- Zombie slash attacks push the player in the direction the zombie's arm swings,
  opposite of how Half-Life 2 zombies do it.
- Fiddled with some weapon viewmodels, moving them closer to the center of the
  screen.  These can be adjusted by editing the ViewModelFudge entry in
  the scripts/weapon_XYZ.txt file for the particular weapon.
- Tweaked the spawn orientation of weapons in some maps to match the original.
- Moved the player spawn position in alamo0 back a bit so the machete isn't
  automatically picked up off the table.
- Display the "Try not to shoot your own guys" message longer in alamo0.
- Added the original RPG7 reload sound.
- Fixed wrong texture on a lightbulb at end of the truck ride in map nama1.
  It didn't match the same lightbulb in the next map that loaded.
- Reduced the size of the tripmine worldmodel by 1/4 and the chainsaw worldmodel
  by 1/3.
- Added hand-grenade secondary fire: the underhand roll.
- Shrunk and repositioned some of the hud elements.
- Fixed the missing flashlight hud icon caused by a missing font definition in
  ClientScheme.res.
