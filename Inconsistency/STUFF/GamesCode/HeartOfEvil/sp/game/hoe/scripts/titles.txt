USE_LETTER1
{
(Translated from Vietnamese)

To whoever should find this,

I am writing this in the hope that someday this madness
will end and someone will read my words and know what
took place in this town.  I feel sure that I will be
dead by then.

The first attacks by the creatures came several months
ago.  Men started returning from the jungle talking of 
attacks by strange, violent animals... or sometimes they
just didn't return at all.  They believed they were evil
spirits.  At first few people believed them, but we soon 
found out first-hand exactly what they were talking about.

I remember the first time a Creature was sighted in the
town.  It killed two people and badly lacerated a third
before someone managed to find one of the local GIs, who
shot it with his machine gun.  We started to lock our
doors and make sure our children stayed inside, but we
were disorganised and we simply weren't prepared for how
many of them there were.  
}

USE_LETTER2
{
By the time we realised the extent of the problem, it
was too late.  A lot of people tried to flee the town, 
but I doubt if they got far - the jungle was swarming
with creatures by that time.  The rest of us started
to band together, barricading ourselves inside the
largest buildings and preparing for the worst.

That was how General Dhong rose to power.  He claimed
to be high up in the North Vietnamese Army, but who 
knows if that's true or not?  All that mattered was 
that people followed him.  He gave speeches in the 
centre of town, and everyone would come and cheer.
Instead of attributing the creatures to evil spirits, 
as everyone else had been doing, he placed the blame 
for them squarely on the Americans.  That was why the 
local Viet Cong supported him.  

The General got everyone to erect huge barricades in
the streets to keep the creatures out.  (Later, we
realised they were also to keep the people in.)  At
first it was voluntary, but soon his VC army began
threatening and beating anyone who did not co-operate,
or was considered not to be working hard enough.  
People supported him, those that weren't being beaten,
because he was keeping the creatures out.
}

USE_LETTER3
{
All food and fuel in the town was confiscated by
the General's men.  Ostensibly this was so that it
could be rationed out fairly in the event of a
protracted siege, but it also meant we were now
dependant on the General for everything.  Some people
objected to having their houses raided and their 
supplies taken, but they were accused of having
'bourgeous ideals' and sympathising with the Americans,
who were the ones responsible for this mess.

The General began having public trials in the centre
of town, where supposed dissenters to what he called
The Revolution were publicly indicted, tried and 
convicted.  They were always guilty.  They were then
strung up outside the barricades for the creatures 
to devour.  

Later, he came up with the idea of capturing creatures
and feeding 'enemies of The Revolution' to them in
the stadium - which he renamed 'The People's Stadium'.
It wasn't a misnomer.  The People loved it, standing
up and cheering ecstatically at the site of those who
had once been their friends and family being torn to
shreds by creatures.  I believe as long as the General
is able to supply them with food and executions, and
keep the creatures out, he will have their full support.
}

USE_LETTER4
{
I have managed to escape from the General's compound, 
and am hiding out in this apartment block.  If the 
General's men find me, I'm dead.  If the creatures 
find me, I'm dead.  I've placed tripmines on the 
entrances to the building, and the area is booby-
trapped.  It's a poor defense but it's better than
nothing.  

I have found an old minibus near the General's
compound that still has some fuel in it.  I believe
it could come in useful somehow.  In order to prevent
anyone else from using it, I've removed the tyres
and hidden them in various places around the town.
I altered the axle to make sure only those tires
would fit it, and marked them with the symbols from
a pack of playing cards: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs
and Spades.

One is hidden on the top floor of this apartment,
another is in a stall in the market place, another 
is next to the barricade where the prisoners are 
hanged, and the last is in the old gas station.

The gas station is barricaded shut, but I think the
creatures got in through the sewers; there's no sign
of life there anyway.  You can get anywhere through 
the sewers; I even heard a couple of 'enemies of the 
people' once escaped from the prison cells through 
the sewers.
}

USE_LETTER5
{
Captain Freeman,

I thought you were dead, but rumour has it you are
still alive.  If this is true, there are some things
you should know about your mission - and about Kurtz.  

Colonel Kurtz passed through this base back in June
on his way upriver.  He was on a mission to field test 
some secret new weapon.  He had a group of SOG guys 
with him, I didn't ask.  Later on, late August, I 
heard that the field tests were cancelled.

It was around September that we started getting messages
from Command asking about Kurtz's stay here: had he
been acting strangely at all, had he said anything
unusual?  It was also around then that the first 
creatures were sighted.

On the fourth of November another man from Special 
Forces stopped with us on his way upriver.  His 
mission was identical to yours: to assassinate
Colonel Kurtz.  No more was heard from him until
late yesterday evening, when we received a letter from 
him carried by a nervous Vietnamese courier.  The guy 
had been running across creature-infested countryside 
all night, I don't know how he made it through - 
anyway he was pretty desperate to get out of here.
}

USE_LETTER6
{
The letter read simply:

"When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will
walk the Earth."

This morning I had my last radio conversation with
Command.  They told me they were assuming their
assassin was dead and they had sent another man -
you - to kill the Colonel.  Then I told them
about the letter.  I also asked for more backup 
to fight the creatures, as I have done every day 
this week.

There was a long pause and a whispered conversation
which I did not catch properly.  Then the guy on
the radio told me in a hurried voice that backup 
would be sent very soon now - and hung up.  We have
been unable to establish contact with them since 
then.

It is clear to me now that the generals want us all 
dead, and soon they will come to destroy us.  I have 
decided to take my chances upriver.  I will wait for
you for a few hours in the boathouse, but if you do
not come I will go on alone.

available to us.  In order to be able to respond
better to the creatures attacks, we have volunteered
Private Bob Neuman to maintain several weapons 
caches which can be quickly accessed
by defenders.  So far we have:

- A captured RPG7 in the food storage area above the

- An M60 in the armory by the airfield.

The Auxiliary Power Generator

When Buon Rau Bang Nui base was expanded in 1967 to

original mains supply from Dong Hoi was inadequate
for all of our needs and the auxiliary power generator
was built.  

Maintainance:

The generator is protected by a combination lock.  It
can be turned off by blowing the fuses in the following
sequence: 1:D 2:E 3:B 4:B 5:A

Memo: 20th September 1968
Lt-Col. Bob Samuels, C/O, Buon Rau Bang Nui.

Received a message from Command today concerning the
recent visit of Colonel Bob Kurtz to Buon Rau Bang Nui.
They wanted to know, was he acting strangely at all?
Apparently they'd had some peculiar messages from him:
a couple of human ears sent in paper envelopes.

I told them I don't care whatever's going on up there,
I got bigger things to worry about.  It's been two days
since we lost contact with the upriver patrol, and even
if their radio broke down they should have returned by
now.  Yet all our intelligence shows no enemy activity 
in that sector.  Where the Hell are those guys?

I remember when I was with special forces.  It
seems a thousand centuries ago.  We went into
a camp to innoculate some children.  We left the
camp after we had innoculated the children from
polio.  And this old man came running after us
and he was crying, he couldn't see.  We went back
there, and THEY had come and hacked off every 
innoculated arm.  There they were in a pile.  A
pile of little arms.  And, I remember 
I cried, I wept like some grandmother, I wanted to
tear my teeth out, I didn't know what I wanted to
do.  And I want to remember it, I never want to
forget.  

And then I realised, like I was shot with a diamond 
- a diamond bullet right through my forehead, and 
I thought my god the genius of that.  The genius, 
the WILL to do that.  Perfect, genuine, complete, 
crystalline, pure.  And then I realised, THEY were 
stronger than we.  Because they could stand that 
these were not monsters, these were men - trained 
cadres - these men, who fought with their hearts, 
who had families, who had children, who were filled 
with love, but they had the strength to do that.  
If I had ten divisions of those men then our 
troubles here would be over very quickly.

You have to have men who are moral, and at the 
same time who are able to utilise their primordal 
instincts to kill, without feeling, without passion, 
without JUDGEMENT, because it's judgement that 
defeats us.

One evening coming in with a candle I was startled
to hear him say a little tremulously, "I am lying
here in the dark waiting for death."  The light was
within a foot of his eyes.  I forced myself to
murmur, "Oh nonsense!" and stood over him as if
transfixed.

Anything approaching the change that came over his
features I have never seen before, and hope never
to see again.  Oh, I wasn't touched.  I was
fascinated.  It was as though a veil had been rent.
I saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre
pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror - of an
intense and hopeless despair.  Did he live his life
again in every detail of desire, temptation, and
surrender during that supreme moment of complete
knowledge?  He cried in a whisper at some image,
at some vision, - he cried out twice, a cry that
was no more than a breath - 

"The horror!  The horror!"

Having reviewed the latest set of data your team

that:

1. The field experiments MUST be halted as a 
matter of utmost urgency.  

2. It is in the interests the United States public 
and indeed of mankind as a whole that, in order to
prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, the 
craft be transferred to a location in the United 
States and its existence remain an official secret 
for the forseeable future.

3. While we are preparing the equipment to dig it
out and ship it, the craft must continue to be guarded
scrupulously in order to prevent its discovery by
hostile interests.

Observations on the creatures, Part 1, Issue 5...

...exceptionally tough hides and, perhaps even more 
importantly, the simplistic anatomy, makes them
impervious to all but the most determind assault
with conventional weapons.  Like insects, their
strategy is to reproduce fast and avoid the heavy
dependence on complex organs such as brains that
makes most larger animals so vulnerable...

...Dr Bob Karlson's preliminary research into tumour 
growth on the new samples turned up more surprising
results.  Despite being around 150 percent more 
susceptible to cancers than the control group, the
new samples were also found to be better able to
tolerate them and indeed adapt to them.  The
committee notes that, if they could be controlled,
the creatures could make a perfect weapon of last 
resort in the event (God forbid) of a nuclear war, 
since instead of killing them the radiation would 
in all likelihood make them stronger...

...conclusion, the unique physiology of the
creatures, if it can really be harnessed, represents 
a powerful weapon for the free world in the fight
against Communism.  Just think of all the good we 
could do with this kind of power in our hands!

Observations on the creatures, Part 4, Issue 7...

...control system was established.  Although
still very imperfect at this stage, we do seem
to be able to give them creatures orders which
they will obey to the extent that their 
intelligence permits...

...Unfortunately the most persistant problem,
which we have not yet been able to make any
headway at all with, is training them not
to attack us.  The only thing we know of which
they will not attack is members of their own
species (and there are even some exceptions to
this)...

...therefore proposed that if a human being 
were injected with the drug instead, it would 
appear to the creatures as a member of their 
own species and therefore not be attacked, and
that this could be adopted as a temporary
solution.  However, it is unclear to what 
extent the same side effects would...

...speculated that the creatures subscribe to a
hierarchical leadership structure, like ordinary
animal groups, where if a member of the
pack challenges and kills the dominant male,
he will become the new leader of the pack...

To whom it may concern:

It's no use, we've been overrun.  We should have
exterminated the creatures when we had the chance, 
but there are too many of them now.  They're not smart,
but they just keep coming.  I can't take it anymore.
My entire unit is gone.  I don't want to become one of
them.
I've been saving a few cartridges in my old 870 specially
ever since we began running low on ammo.  If you're 
already dead, they lose interest in you.  I don't want 
my body walking around killing people after I'm dead.
If you should read this, don't try and contact my
family.  It's best if they don't know how or why it
happened.  Just get out of here.  Get away from this
place.  Run, I tell you, run!  Oh shit, I hear them.
They're coming.  This is it!
Sincerely,
Bob Dickinson.

PS. Look out, there's a zombie behind you!  Kidding.

Here is the translation of the encoded radio transmission
we received from Command at Long Binh this morning:

YOUR MESSAGES HAVE ALL BEEN RECEIVED STOP APOLOGIES FOR
DELAY STOP OUR FAULTY RADIO EQUIPMENT UNDERGOING EXTENSIVE
REPAIRS STOP WE UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHISE WITH YOUR
PREDICAMENT STOP UNFORTUNATELY MEN HARD TO SPARE AT THIS
TIME STOP ARE SENDING ONLY AVAILABLE AIR CAVALRY DIVISION
TO AID YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE STOP EXPECT REINFORCEMENTS
WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS STOP HANG IN THERE END

I can't believe they tried to blame their silence on
faulty radio equipment!  It's plain to see we'll all be
dead by the time they arrive anyway, the way things are
going.  They know if any of us make it out of here alive
we'll tell the world what we saw and they'll have to
admit they made a mistake.  We're screwed.

Journal of Dr. Bob Lewis
4th December, 1968

Today some of the men were able to capture a live specimen
of one of the creatures for the first time.  Their numbers
have shown a dramatic increase over the past few weeks -
patrols are reporting contact with one or more of them as
often as three or four times a day now, which suggests
that they must be breeding at a truly phenomenal rate.
So little is known about them!

Our analysis of their anatomy has so far proved fruitless;
we remain just as baffled about their physiology, their 
physical needs, and of course their origin, as we ever 
were.  This  captured specimen represents a marvellous and 
unique opportunity to observe their behaviour in the 
controlled atmosphere of the laboratory.  If only we had 
better facilities here.  A military hospital is hardly an 
ideal place to conduct scientific research.
}

FREEMAN28A
{
All my requests to Command for better equipment have so
far gone completely unanswered.  This does not surprise me.
Indeed, it merely serves to further confirm my suspicions
that these creatures are not a hitherto undiscovered 
indigenous species or an aberration of nature, but are in 
fact entirely the product of the American government.  We 
have been hearing rumours about a revolutionary secret 
project to be tested on the field in 'nam since early '66.  

It seems to me that the experiment has gone badly wrong.  
The creatures are devastating the local wildlife and 
threatening the people.  There is sure to be an outcry back 
home, when the press finds out.

10th December, 1968

The captive creatures in the laboratory continue to exhibit
the same astonishing degree of agression as they have been
doing since they were caught.  They mercilessly attack and
devour any live animals we feed them, but remain strangely
disinterested in meat that has been dead for longer than
a few hours.  This is surely not a strategy that could have
arisen naturally, through evolution.

Besides being unnaturally vicious they are also deceptively
strong.  Bob nearly had his hand torn off by one of them
earlier today, and we are all becoming worried that their 
cages may not be strong enough.  Two more patrols failed
to return today, and the mood among the men is sharply
deteriorating.

In light of all this I have hidden The Gem in the vault and
sealed the door with a combination lock.  To unlock the 
door one must break the fuses in the following pattern:
1:B, 2:D, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E.  Breaking the fuses requires
considerable force to be applied; a shot from my .45
ought to do it.  Failiure to break them in the right
sequence will result in a nuclear explosion and the deaths
of thousands of innocent people.  I believe this will be
an adequate deterrent to anyone wishing to take away my Gem.

I hope no one accidentally knocks them or anything.  I keep
telling the guys not play with my stuff but they never
listen do they?  But the important thing is that The Gem is
safely hidden.  The only way to find out the combination
would be to read this journal, and I don't plan to leave this
just lying around!  Sally says my performance isn't as good
without the mystical powers of The Gem but frankly I pay her
good money so I don't know what she's got to complain about.

The creatures have overrun the perimeter and those of us 
who survived have fallen back into the main buildings and
barricaded ourselves inside.  We've put all our remaining
supplies and ammo in a big pile on the ground floor of
this building, and now we are just waiting.

All night long we've been hearing the sound of gunfire, 
shouts and screams from the nearby buildings.  I've been 
awake for nearly 30 hours now but I couldn't sleep.  None 
of us could.  I'm so tired.  Our food and ammunition are 
running out.  The chain of command is breaking down, 
people are openly disobeying orders from their superiors.  
Lt. Bob Heller disappeared a few hours ago: the story was
he was taking a piss outside and the creatures got him, but
I think it was a couple of the men.  Bob was always 
unpopular with the men.

Journal of Colonel Bob Fish
28th May 1968

Kurtz's visit ended today.  He set off at dawn, heading
further inwards into the jungle and the Cambodian border.

Before he left he told me a story that took place during
one of his earlier tours.  He and his men were under
heavy NVA fire near a village in Dinh Lo province.
They were surrounded, but had been ordered to defend
the village.  It was clear, however, that the enemy
was being supplied with ammunition by some of the
villagers.  What's more, knowing that American troops 
would be loth to shoot at children, the enemy was
using the local children to ferry ammo between them.

After almost twelve hours of intense fighting Kurtz
had lost nearly half of his men.  Frustrated, he
ordered the remaining ones to start firing at the kids.
Running openly back and forth, they made easy targets.
With their supply lines cut, the NVA was finally forced
to retreat and Kurtz held the village.

Journal of Colonel Bob Fish
23rd November 1968

Another man was killed by the creatures today.  The
grunts are becoming frightened and unruly, morale is
dropping fast.  On the plus side, Viet Cong presence
in the area is also decreasing, and the ones we do
run into always seem to be on their way out of here.
The creatures obviously have them spooked as well.

A patrol by Lang Dau caught some prisoners and we 
asked them if they knew where the creatures were
coming from.  According to the report they just
babbled incoherent gook-speak, but there was one
word that kept being repeated: Kurtz.  I am now
certain the creatures come from Kurtz.  The man is
a visionary, he's a prodigy, an ambassador of mercy,
and science, and progress, and fuck knows what
else.  We need, for the guidance of the cause
entrusted to us by the United States and the free
world, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide
sympathies, and a singleness of purpose.  And so
He comes here, a special being, with the power to
do all this.  He has some great purpose with the
creatures, you may be sure of it.

Dearest Angela,

I know it has been a long time since I last wrote,
and I apologise for that.  Ever since Colonel Kurtz
left our base, there have been some peculiar things
happening around here.  The situation is getting
quite out of control.  The local people say Kurtz
has made a pact with the devil.  I cannot be any
more specific than this, since I think this letter
would not make it past the censors if I was.  But I
fear for my life.  Give my love to Mom and Pop, and 
tell them I've moved on from that whole Oedipus 
thing, and I urge them to as well.

Related to that; I have some bad news for you.  I'm
afraid I can no longer continue our engagement.  I
feel it is best that you know: I've found someone else.
His - yes, his - name is Bob, just like mine.  What a
coincidence, eh?  He sleeps in the bunk opposite me,
and was always one of my best buddies here, but
recently we decided to take it one step further and 
declared our undying love for one another.  Do not
judge me too harshly, Angela; the love of a man for
for another man is a noble and beautiful thing, and
impossible to resist when it takes you in its hand.

Yours faithfully,
Bob
