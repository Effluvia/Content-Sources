=============================================================================

This model was origionally created for Quake3 by Bob Bishop in July of 2001.

I extracted and converted the model to HLDM for DocRock and BabyKitKat as
part of their awesome and incredible Half-Life map Mario_Land!

The changes made are very extensive since I started with only the basic mesh
and textures.

All bones, animations and many cleanups on the mesh and textures took several
weeks worth of work before they all finally came together and worked, WhooHoo!

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2, Wally, Photostyler,
mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that let me do what I needed.

All the compiling and decompiling, mesh, texture, skeleton and animation work
was done in Milkshape 1.5.10 (whew, and boy what a job it was!).

Info:

Files included:
Luigi.mdl - The HLDM player version of the game Luigi model file
Luigi.bmp - The picture you see when selecting the model in the game
Luigi.txt - This text file

Place Luigi.mdl, Luigi.bmp and Luigi.txt in a new folder called Luigi,
in valve\models\player folder in your Half Life directory.

** IMPORTANT NOTICE **
This model should NOT be distributed in any kind of commercial
compilation, product or package without my personal approval.

This model CAN otherwise be distributed freely as long as this text
file is included, unmodified, with the package.

And PLEASE don't extract the skin and draw a mustache (it already has a nice one!)
or remove the clothes from it (ARGH!) and release it to the world as yours,
IE: don't be lame. (thanks to NSi for the notice).
