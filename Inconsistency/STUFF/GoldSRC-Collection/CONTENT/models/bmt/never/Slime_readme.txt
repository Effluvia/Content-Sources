IF YOU NEED A PASSWORD TO EXTRACT THE MODEL: The password is "I promise not to steal." Including the capitalized I, spaces, and period.  Don't include the quotation marks.  This is my way of flipping off all the bloody thieves I hear my more experienced modeller friends talking about all the time.

(Monster replacement model for the Zombie.)

This is a (somewhat cute) little blob of slime that oozes along the ground and attacks by extending pseudopods. Slimes like this one can be found in a lot of Japanese games, usually RPGs. Apparently, it's a sterotypical monster type over there. Usually one of the first and weakest enemies you encounter. Sometimes they have eyes or faces drawn onto them. This one doesn't. =) 

Since I had to use a custom skeleton anyway, I tried to make each of the required animations different, for a little variety in-game. This is my first model, so I apologize if there are any errors.

This is my first model.  It was designed for use with the multiplayer cooperative mod Sven Co-op (http://www.svencoop.com)  It moves slower than a normal zombie, has different sound effects tied to the walking animation, and sometimes hides underground for a little bit if you do a lot of damage to it. =P

To use with SvenCoop: 
Put the model in the svencoop\models\yourmapname folder.  Create a monster_zombie or a squad_maker entitiy in your map in WorldCraft, and specify this model.  Distribute the custom model with your map.

To use with your own new Half-Life mod: 
Place the model in the Half-Life\yourmod\models directory.  Rename it zombie.mdl.  Put monster_zombies in your mod, and distribute the model with your mod.  Or if your mod constains custom code, create a new monster type and use this model for the animations. =)

Note: This model uses a custom skeleton and is missing many animations needed for scripted sequences.  As a result, THIS MODEL SHOULD NOT BE USED TO REPLACE THE DEFAULT HL ZOMBIE MODEL IN NORMAL SINGLEPLAYER HALF-LIFE!

If you use this model, try to remember to give me credit.  

NOTE TO THIEVES: Don't be stupid.  Don't upload this model to a model review website, a HL downloads site, a forum, or your own personal HL site claiming you made it yourself.  Doing so would be stupid and asinine, and eventually someone who's already seen this model will know you didn't make it and tell everybody, and you'll just look like an ass.
