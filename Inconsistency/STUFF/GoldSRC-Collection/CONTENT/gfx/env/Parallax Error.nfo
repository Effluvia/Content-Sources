Woopy, I included three views rendered without the lens flare for the truly adventurous. The idea here is so that you can make your own interactive kind that you now see appearing on some games. You just got to substitute and rename the three files them make up your script to put on your own lens flare effect. If you do it and are successful send us a e-mail to the Wadfather so we can go take a look see at it. Good luck and no I don't know how it's done so don't ask me.
