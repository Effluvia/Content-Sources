Description             : Sky from Dwell Sp for Half-Life
                          When I made the sky in Terragen I used a lot
                          of cloud depth.  Some of the clouds look 
                          almost 3d in the game, weird.
                          Moon was just pasted in.
                          It's darkened enough to be a Half-Life night
                          sky.
