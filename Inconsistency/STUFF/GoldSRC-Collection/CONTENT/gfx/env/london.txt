---- Installation -----

Extract all files into your "valve/maps/env" folder. If you can't find a folder
"env" there, create one. You can include this skymap in your Half-Life maps by
using the name "london" in the cl_skyname command line in Worldcraft after you
followed the above steps.


----- Description -----

This is the skymap from my very first deathmatch level for Half-Life, "Audion
Industries" (available on my website). I created the skymap from a photo of
London from St. Pauls Cathedral and some computer generated clouds.
