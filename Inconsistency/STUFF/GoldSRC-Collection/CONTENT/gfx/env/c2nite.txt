c2nite.zip:  Midnight Cityscape -  Environment map for Quake2, Half-life and Sin  
by Murray Christian  (contact: fluxion@ii.net)

Created in Bryce4 and Photoshop 5
released December 21st, 1999
  
It's midnight and most people have gone home. But there's still a few around, watching the action.

This is the night time version of c2pub
The object of the exercise was to make a high quality, generic night time city sky for maps and mods. (Something that seems to be pretty rare.)
How did I do?
I learnt plenty about Bryce while making it; mainly, don't use too many lights!
Each angle took around 40hrs to render. As it is I didn't place all the lights I planned.
Instead I drew most of them in, with better results in a lot of cases.
The down angle is just a quick render too, but you shouldn't be able to see it anyway.
The sky works best if only seen from the horizon up. (or thereabouts)

There are three models in this sky: Autodesk headquarters, Building (umm) 
and The Chrysler Building.
all of these are uncredited but thanks to Avalon for hosting them.

The rest was made by me, via the techniques of terrain wiz Yuji Nishimoto

Instructions:
This zip contains the files for Quake2
place them in directory  Quake2/baseq2/env/
or check with the makers of whatever mod you're using it with.

For placement and use of skies check Primordial Soup's procedure.
http://www.telefragged.com/soup/
and check out Darc's own lovely skies while you're at it.

Some games support higher res skies; eg Quake2 will use a sky that's 512x512, as will Sin.
If you want a large version of this sky, mail me and we'll sort out a file transfer. (All my skies start out at 512x512, but the files are too large to be posting all over the place.)


Agreement stuff:
If you do anything with this sky, please tell me about it and keep this .txt file with it.
This sky is free for use by mappers or anyone else not trying to make a profit from it.
If you're not sure, drop me a line. (you might be surprised how agreeable people can be).


enjoy
