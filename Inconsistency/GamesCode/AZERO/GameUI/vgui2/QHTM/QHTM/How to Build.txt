How to build QHTM
=================
In these instruction replace <drive:> with the drive letter where you will
build QHTM.
e.g. If my main drive is "C:" then
	"<drive:>\projects"
becomes
	"c:\projects"


Directory Structure
-------------------
My directory structure is as follows, this is detailed in general on my web
site at http://www.gipsysoft.com/articles/project/index.shtml:
<drive:>
    \    projects
    \    projects    \    components
    \    projects    \    components    \    QHTM
    \    projects    \    components    \    QHTM    \    APIExample
    \    projects    \    components    \    QHTM    \    APIExampleStatic
    \    projects    \    components    \    QHTM    \    QHTMMFC

You will need to add "<drive:>\projects\components" to your search path. In
WindowsNT do this from the control panel applet System. In Windows 9x you
will need to edit your autoexec.bat file and add it to the PATH environment
variable.

Next, go into DevStudio Options dialog and choose the Directories tab. Add
"<drive:>\projects\components" to your include and lib directories.

The library header files and the LIB and DLL files all get put in the
"<drive:>\projects\components" directory.


Compiling
---------
To build QHTM open the devstudio project "<drive:>\projects\Components\QHTM\QHTM.dsw".
You should build "Win32 Debug" and "Win32 Release" configurations.

From the QHTM project you can also build the two examples, they are setup to build
without change and to link with the production DLLs.

APIExampleStatic demonstrates how to build the project and all of it's components statically
linked and therefore removes the need for an extra support DLL.


It won't build!
---------------
If you have any problems email support@gipsysoft.com, before doing so please ensure all files
are properly extracted and that every attempt has been made to resolve the problem yourself.


Bug reporting
-------------
If you find a bug please send me the minimum needed to reproduce the problem, the smaller the
samples, C++ or HTML, the quicker I will find a solution. I intend to add a forum to the
GipsySoft.com website where problems can be reported and commented on, as well as suggestion
publicly aired. Please bear with me while I get this set up.

Thanks for purchasing QHTM. if you have any suggestions or queries don't hesitate to contact me.
