It has been brought to my attention that some maps listed are not current server versions.  This might be the case, but the maps listed above are actual releases from old betas and versions.  All maps with the [sv] beside them are maps currently in use on servers, these might not be the actual releases.  Some maps I will NOT be updating to server version.  I.E. cs_siege_apcr is the REAL version of cs_siege apc, the first release of this map where you could actually see out of the apc, most servers will NOT be running this version, hence why the "r" is at the end.
