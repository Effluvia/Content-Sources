Background: After a AAA gun cripples a transport helicopter during an escort mission,
a group of CT's and a valuable government official find themselves deep within
enemy territory.  A military helicopter has been dispatched and will be waiting in
a clearing near a supply bridge.  If the helicopter has been compromised, a rescue
unit will be prepared for a rendezvous at waypoint Bravo, five minutes down the main
road, which is fortified by a turret-enforced road block.

Counter-Terrorists: Protect the VIP at 
all costs. Escort him to either the apache near the bridge
or through the gate at the end of the road that lies
adjacent to the Terrorist camp.

Terrorists: Stick it in the VIP's pooper.
