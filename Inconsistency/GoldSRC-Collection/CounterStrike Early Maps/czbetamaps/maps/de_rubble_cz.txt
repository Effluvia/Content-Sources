Terrorists have developed a deadly DNA
altering chemical which manipulates the
body's DNA structure causing bloodviens
to harden solid within minutes. They 
were trying to ship this chemical out to
other allied countries, but plans were
interupted. So in retaliation, they've
decided to explode and spread the
chemical here, in hopes of infecting
CT's to aid in they're escape.

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing crates containing DNA
altering chemical agents.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten targeted areas.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must detonate one of the chemical
altering agent shipments.
