City of Industry (cs_industry) - Hostage Rescue

My first attempt at a large CS Beta 3
map.  The texturing is drab, and the
building interiors are too bright, but
this map really represents what CS could
be.  Every time I've seen it played the
Counter-Terrorists have used the outer
buildings to seige the Terrorist
building, set up sniper points, and
coordinate rushes inside.  A tactical
joy, but an ugly map.
