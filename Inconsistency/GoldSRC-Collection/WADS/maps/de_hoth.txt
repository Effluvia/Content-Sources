"Battle of Hoth"

The battle to control Hoth has started.
Hidden within the rocky, snow swept hills
is a second generator which supplies
the rebel base with auxiliary power.  As
part of the Imperial assault, the
generator has been targeted for demolition.

Counter-Terrorists (Alliance): Defend your
bunker and generator.  

Terrorists (Imperials):  Storm the defences
and infiltrate the rebel bunker to disable
the shield and demolish the generator.
