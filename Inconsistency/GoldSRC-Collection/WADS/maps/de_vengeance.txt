Vengeance of the Terrorists - Bomb/Defuse
by Durroon (durroon@gmx.net)

Background: The Counter-Terrorist Force
made a real insidious attack on a
Terrorist base. Now the Terrorists made
plans to sabotage a weapon storage of
the CTs.
They only want to take revenge.

Counter-Terrorists: Defend your base and
defuse all bombs planted at the targets.

Terrorists: Sabotage the big weapon
container or destroy the two fuel tanks.

Other Notes: There are different ways to
get to the two targets in this map.
Im sorry about the bug with the floodlight
(sometimes turning just about 5 degrees or
so). I askes anybody I can, but wasnt able
to find the reason.
