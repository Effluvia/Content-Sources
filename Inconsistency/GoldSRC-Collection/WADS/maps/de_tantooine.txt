Tantooine "Outpost in Begger's Canyon"
by dallen

A small Rebel outpost has been found hidden
within Begger's Canyon.  Imperial forces 
have been sent to prepare the base for
capture.

Imperial troops must destroy both generator
pods on the main gate in order to access and 
shut down the power grid.

Bomb targets are the main generator or the
anti-aircraft ion cannon.
