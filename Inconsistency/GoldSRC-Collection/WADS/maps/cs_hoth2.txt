"Escape from Hoth"

With the successful Imperial bombing 
of the secret rebel generator, the 
"Battle of Hoth" has ended. Unfortunately 
while evacuating the ice planet, a 
snowspeeder has crashed, leaving two 
alliance pilots cold and stranded. 
A shuttle has dropped off a team of 
alliance rebels in an attempt to rescue 
the pilots.
