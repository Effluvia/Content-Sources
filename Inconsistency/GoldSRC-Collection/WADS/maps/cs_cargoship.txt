* Game play *
This map is for 2 teams, the Counter Terrorists and Terrorists. The Terrorists have taken 5 hostages, 
all located in the cock-pit building. The goals here are:
Counter Terrorists	: Take the hostages and bring back them you your respawn point. 
			  And you must kill all the terrorists.
Terrorists		: Protect the hostages and don't let the CT's take em. 
			  And you must kill all the CT's

* Things you need to know about this map *
It should look like a big Cargo ship.

* What more I wanted to do, with the map *
· I wanted that the water should have some Waves, but that made the map laggy, so now it's just plain water.
· I thought of making a third floor beneth everything, but I didn't...maybe i'll make a new version with it.

* Next map *
I will start making my next map to CounterStrike as soon as I got a good idea, have a good idea, but can't do it?
