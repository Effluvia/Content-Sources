Nowhere - bomb/defuse
by Fetzo (BigFetzo@gmx.net)

In the forgotten harbour area employees 
of Kuts Inc. discovered a lost supply 
of arms. The freight disappeared on 
it's way to the local military base. 

Kuts Security: Secure the area until the
freight has been salvaged to complete the
delivery. 

Resistance Fighters: The cargo you had stolen
was discovered. Destroy it at all cost to fight 
government oppression.
