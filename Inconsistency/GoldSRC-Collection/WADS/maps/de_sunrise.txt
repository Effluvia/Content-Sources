It's early morning.
A sabotage team is preparing an enemy
invasion by taking out the communications.

Terrorists: Destroy the communication 
abilities of this base by either breaking 
the radio mast on the cliffside or by 
taking out the communication computers 
below ground level.

Counter-Terrorists: Neither the
radio mast or the computers must be
damaged. Protect the communication 
base from the terrorists.
