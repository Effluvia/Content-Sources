Introduction

If you have questions or comments regarding Worldcraft, or problems
running it, please email:

  worldcraft@acdsystems.com

Read WHATSNEW.TXT for info on new features in this version - open it 
in notepad after you have finished reading this doc.

Also very important: Use the QBSP.EXE that comes with this version of
Worldcraft. It is specially made to work with Worldcraft's multiple
texture files.


Worldcraft
------------

Worldcraft is a Map editor by Ben Morris, author of the DOOM Construction 
Kit.

Worldcraft is a Shareware product. Please support low-cost, independent
software development and register Worldcraft if you use it. See ORDER.TXT
for details.

This is the Quake-enabled version of Worldcraft. It allows you to make maps
for id Software's very cool game, QUAKE. Other games will be supported in 
the future, including Raven's HEXEN 2 project and of course, QUAKE 2. Check 
the following website for up-to-date information on new features and work 
in progress:

  *** NOTE: To run Worldcraft, you must first install Microsoft's ***
  ***    DirectX3, which is available from the WWW page above     ***
                       
As with DCK, I'm always interested in hearing suggestions and bug reports.
If you send a bug report, please include detailed information about
the problem, including:

	1. What went wrong: a description of the symptoms
	2. Error messages that appeared, if any
	3. What you did to 'activate' the bug
	4. The brand name and model of your system's video card.
